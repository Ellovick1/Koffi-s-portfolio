                <h3 class="text-center">FDIC Insured Cash Deposit Account</h3>
                <h5>FDIC, its Establishment & Jurisdiction</h5>
                <p>
                    The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is an autonomous bureau of the United States government instituted under the banking act of 1933, to insure all deposits in the US financial institutions; banks and thrift alliances alike. This initiative was initiated following the failure of thousands of banks to meet the withdrawal demands of depositors in 1920s and inception of1930s consequent on the effect of the stock market crash and the great depression. Apparently, its establishment has forestalled similar occurrences and boosts the confidence of depositors on the US financial institution.
                </p>
                <h5>FDIC, Account Insured vs. not insured</h5>
                <p>
                    The accounts under coverage by FDIC include Checking accounts, Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (NOW) accounts, Savings accounts, Money, market deposit accounts (MMDA), Certificates of deposit (CDs), Cashier's checks, money orders, and other official items issued by a bank. The amount of deposit insured is a given; an amount not smaller than $250,000 per depositor in a particular bank for each ownership class.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Certificate of deposit- Otherwise known as a promissory note is a financial product offered by commercial banks. On reaching a compromise, the depositor lends the bank a predetermined amount for a duration in return for interest. The tenure of investment varies; 6months, one year and so on. However, the amount of interest is a function of the tenure. Commercial banks facilitate loans to their clients using the CD
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Savings account- is an interest accrued deposit account maintained in a financial institution for the depositor. This account is designated to encourage saving and meet short-term financial goals. Accounts owners are steady income earners. A determined minimum balance is allowed for this account type with a relatively low-interest rate; average of 1% annually.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Checking account- Also called a transactional account is held at a financial institution. The financial institution grants the account holder access to the deposited funds for transactional motives and other purposes including bill payment. Funds are withdrawn by writing checks, credit transfer or use of automated teller machines as well as the use of other electronic medium.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (NOW) accounts- Seemingly, NOW are similar to checking account. The difference lies in the fact that the financial institution reserves the right to demand for a written notice; at least 7-days before withdrawals.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Money Market Deposit Accounts- MMDA combines the best features of the checking and savings account including limited check writing right. MMDA is held to fulfil short term debt obligation. Typically, its interest is higher than the checking and saving account but lower than the CD. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These deposit accounts are offered by financial institutions and banks and indemnified by the FDIC to the sum of $250,000 per person at a given bank.
                    Non-deposit products such as mutual funds, annuities, stocks, bonds, and life insurance policies are also progressively being proposed to clients by investment houses, and banks. However, in contrast with the accustomed saving accounts, the FDIC does not insure non-deposit products
                </p>

                <h5>FDIC and Account Coverage</h5>
                <p>
                    FDIC stipulates a coverage up to a limit of $250,000 but it does not follow that all held account are always indemnified to this amount. Coverage is provided based on account ownership. So by holding different account but different classification, a depositor can increase FDIC coverage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Scheduled below are other coverage by FDIC to be considered as an option.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>A Joint account- </b> In a joint account, ownership to deposit is ratified to two or more individual. To qualify for this category, the following requirements must be met. First, parties must be living entities. Other legal entities such as estates, alliances, trusts, partnership are not qualified for joint coverage. Second, parties must demonstrate and possess equal privileges to access and withdraw deposits from the account. Third, parties must ratify the deposit account card except if it was instituted by  an agent, nominee, guardian, custodian, or executor. The fulfilment of these requirement automatically qualifies both parties to the insured deposits in the joint account to a total of $250,000. FDIC stipulates that all equity by parties are equal except stated otherwise.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Certain Retirement Account-</b> A retirement account held and indemnified for a beneficiary by a retirement classification. 3 Qualification for ownership will include-  a self-directed or traditional account. Both  types are insured to a maximum of $250,000,

                        <b>A revocable trust account-</b> This an account kept by one or more party that recognizes one or more legatee to inherit the deposits on the demise of the holder. A revocable trust can be canceled, changed or brought to an end at any time solely at the prerogative of the owner. The owner here refers to the grantor. The ownership category could be <b>Informal revocable trust -</b> payable or remitted on death and the formal <b>revocable trust-</b> living trusts where deposits are controlled during the lifetime of the owner mostly on assets, and estate.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Irrevocable trust accounts-</b> This is a deposit account based on a written compromise of the owner also termed as grantor or trustor who donates deposits or assets to the trust and relinquishes all jurisdiction for a change or cancellation

                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h5>FDIC and bank failures</h5>
                <p>
                    In the events of  bank failure, FDIC work to safeguard indemnified deposits by arranging a sale to a healthy bank. Alternatively, they may pay depositors for their funds to the idemnified limit. The purchase and assumption transaction and the deposit payoff are some methods under which healthy banks bear the responsibility of insured amount.
                </p>
                <h5>FDIC and death of account Owners and Beneficiaries</h5>
                <p>
                    In the event of the death of an account owner, the insurance coverage continues for the next six months as though the owner were alive. Within this time, the coverage will not change except the accounts is re-ordered by an authorized party scheduled to access the account. 
                </p>
