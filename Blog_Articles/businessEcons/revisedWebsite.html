                <p>
                    <img style="float: right; width: 40%; height: 40%;  margin: 10px;" src="/img/website.png"alt="" />
                    A website is considered vital for online and offline business. Before this time, business relied on 
                    physical stores to attract clients and meet other business related activities. Today, Clients are 
                    becoming more and more tech-savvier and having reasons to check out businesses through their 
                    website. Clients visit a site to gain an understanding of the product and services of their potential 
                    service provider. So, as your storefront, you need to create a lasting first impression that will 
                    engage and eventually make visitors become a client. As a start-up or an existing brand, using 
                    the digital market option gives you a competitive advantage in the market place. The layout and 
                    functionality of your web pages can make or break the business. They serve as a 24-hour 
                    marketing platform and a device that ease your life. For a brand seeking to create a tenacious 
                    online presence as well as an impression for the future, a site designed professionally and 
                    uniquely conveys the business core values and sufficiently tracks audience. However, as a result 
                    of the existing do-it-yourself (DIY) website creation platforms, many do not see the need to hire 
                    a professional. While there seems to be some good in designing your website yourself, there are 
                    even better reasons you should contract the services of a professional website design company.
                    Scheduled below are some reasons why you should consider hiring a website company for your 
                    brand.
                </p>

                <h5>1. For a better and improved design</h5>
                <p>
                    Many people adopt the built-in or pre-made website templates for their webpage. In this 
                    case, two issues prop up. Not only that they appear elementary, but you also stand the 
                    risk of using or sharing similar webpage concept and design with some people. Quite 
                    boring. This isn’t an ideal way to go. Visitors need to be engaged and excited each time 
                    they visit your page. Contracting the service of a professional website company with the 
                    technical know-how gives your brand webpage the unique feel it deserves, originality and 
                    improved feel. Unlike templates, designs customized with the goal of the brand in mind 
                    appeals more to visitors. Check out the web pages of great brands such as BMW or
                    Apple, the outlay and design of their product communicate louder than performance. So, 
                    quality brand design and appearance are best handled by the professionals
                </p>
                <h5>2. For a Faster Website</h5>
                <p>
                    When it comes to speed, most of them are below par regarding speed. A slow webpage
                    may arise from a poor coding system, hosting services and plugins. These factors are 
                    essential for a faster functional site. If a site is not expertly coded, it will not function or 
                    display effectively. Such websites tend to experience a slow page loading while the 
                    features and fills on the site seem unusable. When visitors are greeted with such an 
                    experience on your site, promptly, they will proceed to source their information and meet 
                    their needs somewhere else. A website design company assists greatly in designing a 
                    website whose functionality is fast. They rate and test your site with tools such as GTMatrix. GT-Matrix test, evaluate the quality of your site and return the score. A score of 
                    85 and above implies that the website functionality is good whereas a score above 95 is 
                    merely flawless. More so, the choice of hosting services also impacts site performance 
                    and speed. The professional designer has this knowledge and understands how to use 
                    them to improve your website performance
                </p>
                <h5>3. For compatibility with Mobile Technologies and Trends</h5>
                <p>
                    Innovation and technology are dynamic and is fast evolving. Keeping pace with it seems 
                    rather daunting. The website agency does not just design a website; they are up to date on
                    the standards and technological trends in the digital space. The continuously carry out
                    research, and with their outcomes, they build a site which is compatible with current 
                    technological trends. Note; your website is not just about today but for the future as well. 
                    With the daily growth of mobile platforms and digitalization, you require a site that is up 
                    to date with the present requirement to avoid issues of the digital race. Professional
                    website agency is fully kitted with this knowledge. They build a responsive website 
                    which might overcome the challenges of periodic site maintenance, guide you through it 
                    and educate you on its basics. In this way, you do not lag. With the professional, you will 
                    have a webpage that is used today and can adapt perfectly to meet future demands.
                </p>

                <h5>4. For a Positive First Impression</h5>
                <p>

                    services, and company when they visit your website. You may be offering an excellent
                    service, but your site says otherwise. Do not forget clients are becoming tech-savvy and 
                    recognize an excellent webpage on the sight of one. If it is done haphazardly, an 
                    impression is formed around your product. It is just but a matter of time, they inevitably

                    professional, then contact the professionals to impress excellently on your clients
                </p>
                <h5>5. For a Reliable Website</h5>
                <p>
                    Some websites are not reliable. This minute everything works well, but in the next, you 
                    receive an error message upon assessment or when you intend to make changes. Do you 
                    have issues switching or using a different browser to assess a website? These are issues 
                    common to sites not designed by the professionals. You should know that clients desired
                    flexibility and based on their device, could access your site any of the available browsers; 
                    it is also essential that your website is built to function best on all these products as well. 
                    With the assistance of a professional website design company, your site is developed to
                    work appropriately with these browsers including Safari, Opera Mini, Internet Explorer, 
                    Chrome, and Firefox. An experienced website designer is well kitted with the technical 
                    know-how to consolidate advanced coding system and functionality for a better 
                    experience and comfort of your visitors. When your site is reliable, confident is 
                    enhanced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, website reliability and proper functioning are dependent on periodic maintenance. 
                    You cannot design a website and allow it to run without support. Just like we do service 
                    our auto cars, and machines periodically to be at best, a constant update and 
                    maintenance schedule is necessary to sustain and keep your website running in a perfect 
                    condition. Maintenance activity is done to dispose of old technology, remove irrelevant 
                    matter and replace newer and user endearing functions. Everyone wants to stay up to date 
                    with the trend. It attracts visitors and guarantees repetitive visits to your site. So you see 
                    why it is imperative that you contact a professional?
                </p>
                <h5>6. For SEO friendly and visibility</h5>
                <p>
                    Crafting a website is just a part of the whole but being seen and ranked in Google and 
                    other search engines complete the pack. When you decide to go solo on your website 
                    design, you may likely not be seen. This implies that potential clients will not find nor 
                    contact you. You cannot provide this service since you are limited by skill. The 
                    professional website designer will code your site in a manner that speaks your specific 
                    pages to search engines including Google, Bing, and others rather than bold claims. The 
                    outcome is that you get easily seen each time customers search the product you offer. 
                    Visitation and traction to your site improve, and your client base is likely to increase. Do 
                    not forget, it cost nothing to be noticed, so why not allow the professionals to get you 
                    seen.

                    project initiation to closure while eliminating the risk of delays. When all professionals

                    ideas, anticipate shortcomings and share successes. An experience of this nature produces 
                    a world-class outcome
                </p>
