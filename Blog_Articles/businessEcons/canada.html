                <h3 class="text-center">Tilray, Aurora Cannabis, and Cronos, Canopy Growth Canadian Marijuana Battles to Lead the Us Market</h3>

                <p>
                    The duo of the Canada’s recreational marijuana and European medical cannabis market has seemingly occupied the lime light. At the moment, both maintain a position as the market lead and are currently generating massive returns from big players within the market. However, it is impossible for the market big wigs including Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB), Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC), Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY), and Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON) to have a spot on the US major stock exchange portfolio since marijuana is contraband at the federal tier. Unlike the US cannabis market, the hemp market is legal. This begs the question of which of the top Canadian Marijuana company retains the commanding height of the market; the Canopy, Aurora, Tilray, or Cronos?
                </p>
                <h5>Meet the Potential Market Leaders</h5>
                <p>
                    <img style="float: right; width: 100%; height: 40%;  margin: 10px;" src="/img/marketLeaders.png"alt="" />
                    Canopy Growth and Tilray are already seeking a spot as potential leaders in the US market.  Since acquiring the Colorado-based hemp research firm; ebbu in October 2018, Canopy’s operations was restricted to that of research only. A move which assisted it fulfil the condition for listing in Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) at the time hemp was illegal in the US. Early this year, Canopy rolled out its major growth decision for the future to include; obtaining a franchise to grow and process hemp in New York State, financing the building of hemp industrial park in the range of $100 million and $150 million in New York. In his company's Q3 conference call in February, the CEO and Founder of Canopy Growth, Bruce Linton expressed optimism over the proposed listing of the hemp CBD products on the US market and a possible construction of a hemp production facility  before the year winds down.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Closely following the Canopy Growth is the Tilray. Back in February, Tilray declared its intention to splash over $318 million on the world's largest hemp; Manitoba Harvest. About 16,000 stores in North America retails Manitoba Harvest's hemp-based food produce. 13,000 of these stores of reside in the United States. In January, it declared that it was partnering with a U.S.-based Authentic Brands Group (ABG) to expand the consumer cannabis market globally. Brendan Kennedy, CEO of Tilgray stated in the company's quarterly update that the firm’s was interested in the US CBD products and with the acquisition of the Manitoba Harvest, Tilgray now has a built in supply chain for conveying CBD to ABG.
                </p>
                <h5>The straggler</h5>
                <p>
                    <img style="float: right; width: 30%; height: 40%;  margin: 10px;" src="/img/straggler.png"alt="" />
                    Unlike Canopy and Tilgray, Cronos Group and Aurora Cannabis are stragglers. Neither of the two has expressed intention to expand in the US market. Responding to the question regarding the option of hemp-based CBD in the US, Aurora CEO, Terry blamed their failure to carryout major operation in the US market on the uncertainty around the legal status of the product in the terrain. However, plans are on; to gain entry once the issues are resolved, he added. Aurora has considerable hemp capabilities; in addition to their asset; Agropo and it the Uruguay-based hemp grower ICC Labs, its majority stake in Hempco Food and Fiber undoubtedly makes it the largest hemp producer in Europe. Cronos Group; the first Canadian marijuana stock to be listed on Nasdaq through its CEO Michael Gorenstein declared in Cronos Group's Q4 conference call that part of their plan in the previous year was to integrate majorly in the US market but concrete actions were yet to commence. Cronos’s relationship with the US cannabis industry stakeholders is great. We will continue to watch the U.S. hemp opportunity very closely, he added.
                </p>
                <h5>Chances of Success </h5>
                <p>
                    Clearly, among the major Canadian marijuana producers in the US market, stragglers and leaders exist. The market is volatile and so for Aurora and Cronos; expansion was eminent in the dearest future. Both Cam Battley of Aurora and Gorenstein of Cronos Group's declared that their company was not just ready to divulge their strategy concerning the US market just yet  
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, for Tilray, a more promising future awaits it on the US hemp CBD market. Its potential is linked to its Manitoba Harvest. The Manitoba Harvest will ease the retailers and consumers relationship for Tilray and will support its deals with ABG. Canopy Growth will take months to inaugurate its first hemp CBD products. It has the financial capacity to invest and also partners with Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ); a company with great track record; thanks to Constellation's $4 billion investment. When CBD-infused beverages market and regulatory issues are resolved by the authorities, Canopy's relationship with Constellation will play to its favor. There is a greater chance for independent state laws for marijuana producers.By then, the major Canadian marijuana growers will integrate perfectly in the U.S. marijuana market. Canopy's partnership and funding support money from Constellation will be a key driver a success. Looking ahead, Canopy is better positioned to succeed in the US cannabis market.
