                <p>
                    The First concern on HR analytics is the technology choice dilemma. Identifying the right data technologies compatible with in-house operations can be exhausting. Human resources professionals depend on IT-departments for those crucial technological choices; but no other department know exactly the needs of HR well enough as the human resources departments. HR analytics arrives with solutions to which the job of getting HR professionals educated on them can be very overwhelming and demanding.  More so, HR managers aren’t data analyst by training. The lack the knowledge of data storage, management, data quality, data manipulation and visualization. Many even sweat at the mention of big-data, hence they may find it challenging. Finally, data is complex. Putting up a team to analyze firm data may be challenging, demanding and costly.
                </p>
                <p>

Based on the responses of the survey participants, it was determined that the future of HR analytics will most likely be driven by a focus on integration. While the current focus of HR analytics is mostly on HR difficulties, which necessitates the use of HR data, the future emphasis is expected to shift to broader organizational challenges, which will necessitate data beyond the HR domain and even the business as a whole. Employee data will be integrated with data from finance, sales, marketing, social media, and personal devices. Regardless of whether this integration entails the development of enterprise-wide systems or data warehouses, all disciplines' data would be integrated in a single database for combined analysis hence; enhancing productivity, performance, more incisive decision, timely information retrieval.
