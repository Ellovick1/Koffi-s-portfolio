                <h3 class="text-center">Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI)</h3>

                <p>
                    The LMI is a one-off cover or payment made to a mortgage lender to shield them against non-remittance or failure. Typically, the need to pay for LMI arises when your loan to value ratio is 80% or more. In other words, if more than 80% of the asset’s worth is borrowed from the lender, you will have to pay the LMI premium. When you are acquiring a home, every cent of your savings is essential. Do you have enough saving, large enough to be used as a deposit to buy yourself a house? If not, then there is a high likelihood of paying the Lender’s Mortgage Insurance. For an individual who is making his first attempt to own a property, this cost could be overwhelming. For this reason, the best approach is having a prior understanding of the LMI and taking steps to avoid the Lenders Mortgage Insurance.
                </p>
                <h5> How do you avoid Lenders Mortgage Insurance?</h5>
                <p>
                    <b>1.	Work in a profession which is qualify to avoid LMI:</b>  Some professions are viewed as less risk borrowers. Applicants in such profession may enjoy a waiver on LMI up to 90%. The professions include doctors, engineer, lawyers, accountant etc. Clearly, there are exceptions; for other professionals, a down payment of about 20% is required to get the LMI waived. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>2.	Save more deposit:</b> Evidently, one way of avoiding the LMI is to continue saving until you reach a home loan deposit threshold that is enough to dip your Loan to Value Ratio (LVR) to an amount that is lower than 80%. It is vital that you check and get clarity on the required LMI rules from your Lender. An applicant who saves more may be qualified for a real savings discount. In such conditions, rather than receiving an LMI premium rate, standard LMI rates apply. The standard LMI rate is affordable and less priced than the LMI premium rates. You are better off In the long run. In this way, you can buy a house without recourse to the Lenders Mortgage Insurance. 
                </p>
                <p>
                   <b> 4.	The use of a cover Guarantee:</b> Typically, this entails acquiring a guarantor; a person mainly a family member to perform the obligations connected with a guarantee. Some equity in the home or investment assets of the guarantor may be required to be used as a cover or security for the loan to be borrowed. If this happens, your Loan to Value Ratio (LVR) must have been reduced to a value less than 80%; thus knocking off the Lenders Mortgage Insurance. However, you need to note a few things concerning this arrangement.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In the event that you default on the loan repayment plan, the lender could demand recovery from your guarantor.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The lender may utilize the right to dispose of the guarantor's asset or property should he fails to meet up with obligations. It is necessary that the guarantor autonomously acquire financial and legal counseling for a proper brief on the inherent risk implication 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <b>5.	Consider other lenders to avoid LMI to 85%:</b> If the option of having the LMI premium waived is not forthcoming, then be sure to choose the right lender and insurer.  Lenders consider the risk of the loan amount and type differently. This informs the premium they price. In other to select the right Lender, you can seek the assistance of a mortgage broker to source for LMI which is reasonable and affordable. Your broker will compare the rates of different banks or lender and suggest one that meets your need.
