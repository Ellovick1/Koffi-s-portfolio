                <p><img style="float: right; width: 100%; height: 40%;  margin: 10px;" src="/img/passingIncome.png"alt="" /></p>

                <p>
                    Depending on what you want, or feel will work well for you, generating passive 
income may instantly conjure some thoughts about taking surveys, blogging or
even some networking/pyramid scheme. More so, you may even have people 
flooding your mind with tons of idea to help you earn a few more bucks from 
the sideline.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, what do you believe and what do you ignore, what's authentic and what's 
not? It seems you find yourself in the crossroad of not knowing which option is 
best when it comes to generating passive income?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let’s hope that you’ll give this a deep thought. The candid truth about 
generating a passive income source is not any pyramid scheme or blogging with 
special collaborative and marketing technique, nor will a savings account be the 
most feasible source of passive income. Investment in real estate is the key.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a real estate investment, you can earn money through the conventional 
way to add to your income streams. As it may interest you to know, real estate 
investment is the most realistic way of keeping more money in your bank 
account without worrying about any alarm regarding your identity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, like every other passive source of income, you may think of, real 
estate investment requires you to be smart. Also, you’ll have to invest one or 
three of these; money, work and time. That's if you truly want to get to that level 
where your assets earn for you even while you hit the hay sack.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may cut in, real estate? Isn't it so expensive and time-consuming to invest 
in? Well, contrary to your notion about real estate, it is easy to find a 
conventional brick and mortar structure where you can fix up then rent it out. 
It’s a sure bet that once you are able to fix up a few units, you can only sit back 
to watch the returns on investment flood your account seamlessly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More so, there are various ways you can generate passive income through 
investment in real estate. If only you are willing to invest your resources to 
these passive income secrets below, you’ll be earning passively without raising 
a brick for the rest of your life.
All that you need is know where to kick off, then decide on what resource you 
can afford to invest if you want to see your passive income stream start flowing. 
Here are some top secrets to generating passive income for yourself.
                </p>
                <h5>Passive Real Estate</h5>
                <p>
                    With a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), all your money is adequately 
invested in real estate. And since it is the REIT that takes ownership of the 
property, you have little or nothing to worry about who handles or shuttles the 
duties of the landlord. <br>
When investing in REIT, you are sure to be receiving higher returns even more 
than bonds, bank investment and stocks will give you. Also, you may choose to 
sell your returns in a REIT at any time you choose – this makes it very flexible 
even than having full ownership of a real estate. <br>
If you have difficulty in deciding which REIT will help you achieve your 
passive income dream, these few below can be the perfect spot to take off
                </p>
                <h5><a href="https://fundrise.com/"> Fundrise</a></h5>
                <p>
                    Fundrise works best for people with little or no managerial skill, time or
even upfront cost to buy a house, or if you wouldn’t want to be seen as a 
landlord. These guys can help you real good. All you need to do here is 
buy shares, and with your money invested in their shares, the money will 
be invested in developing a couple of real estate projects under their care. 
As these projects get completed and begin to boom, so do you. 
Unlike the traditional real estate deal which requires lots of money from 
your pocket, Fundrise gives you easy access into the real estate industry 
with as little as $500 which may even be less than your wardrobe 
allowance from your main job.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, they have different investment strategies that will suit your 
passive income goal. Your goal may be a long term growth, balanced 
investing or even a supplemental income, no problem about that – there is 
always a plan to fit you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, Fundrise gives you an open cheque of investment where you 
choose from a list of their project which one you would want to invest in.
                </p>
                <h5><a href=""></a></h5>
                <p>
                    If you didn’t fancy the concept and offer that Fundrise brings to the table, 
but still need to invest in real estate with minimal risk, Realty Mogul 
might just be the guys you hope to work with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Realty Mogul is a renowned private REIT that boasts of an average return 
of 8% for accredited investors. They bask on a unique 1031 exchange 
platform which permits an investor to sell their current real estate 
investment and reinvest their returns in a new property. With this, 
investors can evade tax payment only if they can complete the whole 
exchange process within six months (180 days). With tons of successful 
1031 exchange recorded by Realty Mogul, they can confidently assure 
their investors of instant passive investment without Excrow, Closing 
Cost or Agents.
                </p>
                <h5>Vacation Rental (Rent Your Space) </h5>
                <p>
                    You can as well earn massively from this great and quiet way of investing in 
real estate. Although this method is more of a hands-on method of investing in 
real estate all you need to do is rent out your vacation apartment, home or even 
a single room and watch the returns raise your account figures.
Looks like this option makes more sense to you, right? You can check out these 
renowned firms to get your home listed.
                </p>

                <h5><a href=""></a>Airbnb</h5>
                <p>
                    This site gives people a better landing spot while traveling to various 
places around the world. With Airbnb, people travel to stay in wellfurnished apartments that are way less expensive than conventional 
hotels. With this website, you can enlist your home into three categories 
thus; entire home shared a home, or private room. This gives your guest a 
wide variety of options to choose from. 
How do you earn, right? For every booking to your home, Airbnb 
charges you a token sum of 3% of the total sum while your payment is 
remitted into your bank account 24hours after your guest check-in. 
Instead of leaving your home to sit empty, you can use this simple 
approach to get extra bucks flying into your bank account.
                </p>
                <h5><a href=""></a>VRBO</h5>
                <p>
                    There is still more to scoop! VRBO is another real property mogul that is 
known for legit home service for both owner and renters.
With VRBO, all you need to do to start generating passive income for 
yourself is simply by listing your property. As soon as it has been given 
out to a guest, you start earning from wherever you are. 
Possibly, you may not want to get engaged in anything but simply sit and 
watch the return coming in, you can get more passive by outsourcing the 
management of your property to them. This might cause you a few bucks,
though, but it is worth the investment.
                </p>

                <h5>Become a Silent Partner</h5>
                <p>
                    Besides real property investment, another investment that is almost like a rival 
to real estate investment when it comes to generating passive income is 
becoming a silent partner.
If you know of any successful business in need of additional funds to expand, 
you can become a sideline angel investor. Yes, no one knows you in relation to 
the business, yet you are earning from it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead of investing your money in the form of loans to business proprietors as 
in the case of peer-to-peer lending, you can simply become a silent partner of 
businesses where you have an equity status in the business. While the business 
owner is solely responsible for the day-to-day supervision and management of 
the business, you only take the position of a silent contributor who participates 
in the proceeds of the business from the comfort of your home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sounds interesting, right? If yes, and you possibly don't know where to start 
from or what business to channel your investment tom <a href="https://angel.co/">AngelList</a> can help you 
become an invisible equity holder of some great companies
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this, you can act as an angel investor to as many companies as your 
investment capacity can go, and in return, you enjoy 100% equity even while 
you are earning passively. What's more than this?
                </p>
                <h5>Bottom Line</h5>
                <p>
                    The secret to generating passive income is well-wrapped in this article. Sure 
you've got to understand that not every means of generating passive income is
