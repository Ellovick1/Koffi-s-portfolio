                <h3 class="text-center">X Tips for Team Management</h3>
                <p>
                    In business parlance, the focus of management is to remain in business irrespective of the complexity that bedevils it. Success demands to stay competitive, but competition is merely a means to ends and not the ends itself. As such, management and managers, therefore, do more to remain relevant;  reacting to business vagaries, the oddity of globalization and squaring up with negative externalities in their domain merely to meet the end; “corporate goals and vision.”  
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to satisfy customers, revamp corporate services, improve turn over rate, and maximize profit, business adopts  strategies including; A flattened and decentralized power, downsizing the labor force, re-engineering the organizational wheel, and empowering of employees. However, these strategies beg the question of sustainability. A more robust and proactive initiative is then essential to creating a viable enterprise.  Team management, therefore, becomes an option.

                <p>
                    Management and Managers are increasingly turning to team management for organizational success. Teamwork is vital for corporate sustainability, but what exactly is a team in modern organization parlance? A team is a troupe of people who collaborate either momentarily or permanently to achieve organizational goal.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Managers are saddled with the responsibility of administering and coordinating a team. Team management, therefore, is elucidated as the capability of a manager to galvanize and influence members of a group to success. It can be an inspiring, a beneficial as well as a daunting process. Often, the over-ornated business environment entrusts managers with little or no time to check-in with members for continuous performance. Seemingly, the higher the challenges the organization encounters,  the more climacteric it is for the team to be efficient. The question is, how can one manage, exercise authority, lead and efficiently manage a team?

                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are a few fundamental tips for effective team management-
                </p>
                <h5>Maintain good team communication </h5>
                <p>
                    Communication is fundamental to successful team management. Employees desire not to be thrown to the kink, rather be informed about ongoing campaigns within the organization. Therefore managers must clearly communicate their expectations and motives to team member, schedule and facilitate a meeting where goals are set, and strategies to accomplish them collectively discussed. It is paramount that the essence of such expectations and future upshot be communicated as well. A compromise arrived in this manner enhances commitment, and shared efforts.  Do not presume that employees understand the method you express your ideas. Ask for feedback if a response is not forthcoming on your initiative. When motives are communicated, a great team is often the product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Be purposeful and communicate respectfully; don’t just tell your team members what you want, but explain to them why” - Jeffrey Morales
                </p>

                <h5>Delegate effectively and trust your team to deliver superlatively</h5>
                <p>
                    To delegate means giving opportunity to team members to become the experts and hence the best. It is an essential component of a manager’s responsibility. However, understanding the rudiment of delegation remains a critical challenge to many managers. Most managers perform virtually all functions, while others assign too much task with limited directives. Neither of the two is appropriate. Effective delegation entails evaluating the strength and weaknesses of individual members and engaging them in roles where their skills set fits precisely. There is a broad distinction between delegating and bossing, so,  avoid the second by adequately furnishing the right staff with the context and expectations for the task. Facilitate and encourage personal responsibility and ownership and finally, schedule time for feedback and appreciation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Surround yourself with the best people you can find, delegate authority, and don’t interfere as long as the policy you’ve decided upon is being carried out.“ - Ronald Reagan
                </p>
                <h5>Proactively detect and resolve conflicts.</h5>
                <p>
                    In a team, conflicts are bound to occur. They are ineluctable and should be considered as opportunities to better things and a stepping-stone to greater experience. However, containing them without jeopardizing the success of the team is critical. The group comprises of diverse people with varying perspectives on issues, and on specific situation, they escalate into conflict. Managers should not disregard disputes because turning a deaf ear could be detrimental. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    "The biggest problems  in the world could have been solved when it was small." - Witter Bynner                                                                                                                                        
                </p>
                <p>
                    Successful team managing demands that managers act proactively, and meticulously work to resolve issues before they become actual problems. Recognize the existence of a dispute rather than pretend it doesn’t exist. Grant the warring parties the opportunity to communicate their disposition, comprehend and acknowledge the different perspective to forge a healthy resolution.  Spot the actual issues, discuss the impact and how it affects the team,  proffer a solution and collectively address it.  Note; It is pertinent that all team members on the discussion table feel satisfied with the resolution offered else their bitterness heightened.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Problems can become opportunities when the right people come together." - Robert Redford
                </p>
                <h5>Champion collaboration</h5>
                <p>
                    Collaboration means working together as a unit intellectually or manually, to foster a relationship with colleagues and customers; function effectively with diverse people, negotiate and manage organizational goals. Managers increasingly perceive collaboration as daunting and challenging. Maintaining the team with the tenet of cooperation is seemingly difficult in the workplace. There is a dire need for managers to encourage collaboration, allow shared vision and participation in the business domain for success. Inevitably, a collaborative team is a happier team.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    A few ways to collaborate-  First, organize team games to build new relationships and mend old ones. Second, collectively brainstorm goals and streamlined processes to fit the big picture. Third, design a collaborating team portal to share documents, information, comments on task and relay feedback. Fourth, build independence and trust among members. Fifth, encourage employees to socialize outside of work, and finally, improve engagements by allowing team members to work from comfortable environments.
                </p>
                <p>"If everyone is moving forward together, then success takes care of itself." --Henry Ford</p>

                <h5>Inspire team members to be the best </h5>
                <p>
                    Managers are not just responsible for their performance but also for the performance of the entire team. Assisting and supporting team, therefore, becomes imperative, so they come out tops in their roles. Managers should understand that when people are financially invested, they want a return, but emotionally invested people will desire to contribute. You are the team leader because you possess all answers to issues. Listen attentively to the need of the team because by doing so, team members build trust and a great deal of ownership. Collectively design and customize Individual Development Plan (IDP) for each member; a strategy for meeting new goals, improving skills and changing work habit. Structure a support and guidance scheme to make follow-ups, check-in and. Finally, recognize the strength of the team members to determine where it suits best.

                </p>
                <h5>Reward and recognize hard work</h5>
                <p>
                    An effective reward system is yet another team managing strategy which is available for managers. Managers should learn to reward and appreciate the effort of the team whenever they perform exceptionally. The recipe feels good and becomes an ambassador; a change agent to the team on the need to work hard. Effective reward system enhances organizational competitiveness, employee retention probability, and reduces turnover. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The employee is a vital resource in the organization and keeping them on the job is the major challenge of the manager. However, when not used properly, rewards can have a debilitating effect on employee performance. So to avoid such occurrences, employee perceptions must be sampled and accommodated when drafting a reward system. For fairness, the requirements for receiving the reward must be communicated publicly to all team members. Managers must then initiate criteria for work performance, acknowledge employees from all units of operation, align performance with benchmarks and offer the reward to deserving team members.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “The object of rewards is to encourage; that of punishments, to prevent. If rewards are high, then what the ruler wants will be quickly effected; if sanctions are heavy, what he does not desire will be swiftly prevented” - Han Fei
                </p>
                <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                <p>
                    The introduction of teamwork is a significant step in organizational success. It is essential that management and managers ensure they understand the contribution of the team to their business strategy. Teamworking is not a finite project but a process of continuous improvement and innovation.  If managers desire high performance, then they should challenge their team regularly to transform the workplace.
