                <h3 class="text-center">Kleptocracy; definition and historical Concept</h3>
                <h5>Introduction</h5>

                <p>
                    In more recent times, kleptocracy; considered as a direct fall-out of globalization has significantly affected business and government in most economies of the world. In the United States, what seemed to be eulogized and commended initially for its role in national strengthening, is now receiving backlashes as a political corollary and related economic concomitant attributable to it periodically unveils. From scoundrel states to insurgencies, terrorism now kleptocracy plagues the sovereign states. Negligence will pose a considerable challenge.  “How the US arrived this point remains a question unanswered. In contrary to the popular belief which represents the political system of the United States as a democratic one, a significant event in time past presupposes it as kleptocratic. 
                </p>

                <h5>Kleptocracy; definition and historical Concept</h5>
                <p>
                    The Cambridge dictionary defines kleptocracy as a society whose leaders make themselves rich and powerful by stealing from the rest of the people; this is anti-democratic etude by the privileged few. Historically, repression and subjugated influence of the labor force, the vulnerable group including the immigrants, poor, women and minorities by Kleptocrats has been extensive. It is not new to the US and is traceable to the 1980s and 1910 era, which was termed the Gilded Age. This age witnessed a significant corporate ascendancy and control of the US Senate (Phillips 2004). Modern-day Kleptocrats in American has a new approach, objectives, and organization. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Interestingly, the present US oligarchy is that in which a vast proportion of the middle class are proponent and disciples of neo-liberalism invoked to rationalize the raid and pillages perpetuated on public resources. The 2000 and 2004 electoral support base for the Boss of the cartel, George W. Bush was provided by these same people. The outcome of these elections was positive for Bush at the time because a large number of American electorate accepted and believed the tenets of the neo-liberalism which opines a market completely havened from the control of the government and regulations. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The neo-liberal school of thought escalated a dilemma which caused the electorate to disavow and decant the government market control. Soon, privatization and deregulation became concrete in certain markets. State element and role was still a significant factor hence the susceptibility of the free market system to the predictive members of the kleptocrats. Contrary to their claim of protecting the health, resources and wealth of the nation by promoting a free market, they safeguarded themselves and that of their cronies economically. In modern times, this has been one of the significant ironies which advanced the course of Kleptocracy and has made it possible for the rise in pillages of public wealth.
                </p>
                
                <h5>Who Rules the United State?</h5>
                <p>
                    As earlier stated, the form of government in the US is Kleptocracy. This is contrary to popular opinion which supposes that it is a democracy. In the outcome of a research by G. William Domhoff  (1967, 2002) titled “Who Rules America”, the corporate environment comprising of business tycoons, seasoned capitalist, directors and the those socially linked with the upper class elucidated by wealth  accrual- stocks, real estate, and bonds subjugate the electoral processes in the US. These policy cartels assist appointed candidates to succeed by financing their election and political ambition. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    They influence these officials to adopt a corporate plan; and appoint their members to high placed public positions, control the foundation of policy by financing and conducting themselves in ways considered unique to the academia, directors of foundations, experts and think tanks, social groups and pressure groups to further their corporate desires, plans and agenda. This corporate control weakens markets and reduces union power. Recent trends shows that these political leaders are emanating from the corporate world have steadily become the Oligarchs of the US economy over the years.
                </p>

                <h5>Globalization and effects of kleptocracy in the US</h5>
                <p>
                    The post-cold war has witnessed the rise of kleptocrats, and their arm twisting capability to the processes of globalization, and significant corruption. Apparently, these cases follow a similar approach- public treasury is looted and funds stacked up in high worth assets and facilities. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike the Russians, Iranians or Chinese, Kleptocracy may affect Americans differently. One factor is sure. The cost of this bad behavior is rising every minute. Routinely, a high volume of illegitimate cash enters the U.S, and this distorts the free market system. For instance; In Manhattan or Miami, it is difficult for an average salary earner to purchase real estate. Kleptocrat imposes their criminal values and practices to use their widely stolen funds to induce the lawyers, and bankers who consider this motivational enough to compromise financial and legal ethics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, tax remittances by taxpayers in the United States continue for a host of global issues linked and traced back to kleptocratic administration. For instance; the Ukrainian government fails to account for about $12 billion deficit in public finance annually yet the US sent assistance in billions of dollars to this corrupt government as loan guarantees. In Iraq, a vast amount of US dollars are used for the reconstruction of broken infrastructure, public education, and strengthening of the military. It is obvious, funds which are stolen ends up in western assets or offshore accounts. While the justice system continues to pursue suspect, these anonymous groups who support financial corruption do not only work about freely but allow to do business in America.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Russia, billions of dollars in their hundredth had been siphoned out of the country over the years. Recent policy by Putin seeks to revise the pension age upwardly. This implies that a considerable proportion of Russian populace will die before their qualification for a state pension. The elderly in particular are already living in poverty. Two possible conclusions can be made from this situation. First, the state coffer has been looted, and so funds are not available fothe r the payment of pension and second, his kleptocratic administration implies a less fund for health care and education.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Conversely, the Russians are plagued with low life- expectancy. Averagely, for the Russians, mid-sixties is the life expectancy. If all the proceeds from oil/gas infrastructures and those in former state-owned alliances had been remitted to the economy and managed by sincere individuals, then the life expectancy would have been considerably improved with health care, education and other indices of wellbeing available to the Russians. Similarly, the United State is steadily following this direction. Policies and agenda of government aimed at protecting the citizens and safeguarding them from the circumventive arm of businesses away from economic exploitation are jettisoned.
                </p>

                <h5>Kleptocracy and the present day America</h5>
                <p>
                    Earlier predictions scheduled the US to follow countries such as Russia, Turkey, China, and many others, who nominate a leader who could make the resources of the country available to a small number of private individuals. A cabal of billionaires including Vladimir Putin and Robert Mercer assisted Trump to power. Inferences drawn is that business was the sole reason these Russian meddled in American democracy especially, when it seems that, international politics and business operations to the Russian government always converge.       
                </p>
                <p>
                    In what it described as the rule of thieves, The Washington Post has attempted to outline the modus operand of kleptocracy. It pre-supposes the rise in the theft of public resources on a significant measure. The United States under Trump’s government is said to be heading this path. Many beliefs that the government is supported by those who are desirous of a tax cut to meet personal gains with little or no interest in the cost implications to the economy. Fortune magazine terms this “the biggest wealth grab in modern history.” 
                </p>
                <p>
                    About 5 percent of the people retain ownership of about two-thirds of stocks and mutual funds in the US. A cut in tax for alliances will imply the transfer of benefit to a few groups. Approximately, about 34 percent of Trump’s December tax cuts benefit a percent of the country’s wealthy while he brings to a halt public sector payments owing to lack of funds.  According to Forbes magazine, his tax policy implies movement of money out of the economy and subsequently redistributing it to corporations, CEOs, and the super-rich.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some issues are raised on the possibility of Kleptocracy. 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        First, censorship on a free press-  Trump frequent tweets about “Fake News. When faced with critical news, or news not to his liking, he labels it as “Fake News” and attacks outlets and networks like CNN, New York Times, and NBC – even going so far as to suggest NBC's license should be revoked. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Second, nepotism described as the appointment of ones relative in a political position. In this case, the appointment of his son-in-law Jared Kusher as White House “senior adviser” and his daughter Ivanka Trump as “adviser.”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Third, Trumps hotel in Washington, D.C. commenced operation just before the election in 2016. Now it is adopted  as a destination for foreign governments industry groups and others, such as  the American Petroleum Institute, Officials, diplomats and lobbyists linked to Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Azerbaijan – As shown by the corruption  perception index, these countries which are classed as corrupt have chosen to host lavish and flamboyant events at the hotel. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The refusal of trump’s  to file his tax returns or place his assets in a blind trust, 
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    In time past, those who permitted autocrats for their interest soon met their low. They were either jettisoned by the system they designed or caught up with justice in the event of its collapse and subsequently punished by democracy. Worthy of note will be the initial days of the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, and the French Revolution, and Nazi Germany. Even those who kept mute while the system decayed were also held accountable. In all of this, care should be taken to protect the United States from becoming a miserable place, socially and economically away from national debts that is not sustainable to future generations.
