                <h3 class="text-center">Reduction of Discrimination in the Workplace</h3>
                <p>
                    Recent report has shown that 80% of Americans have unconscious biases both against women and blacks in executive roles (Jost et al., 2009). Evolutionary psychologists also posit that the brain classifies people by race in less than 100 milliseconds before considering sex. Being bias simply means treating members of a group in unequal manner which may be illegal. There are different types of bias, germane to this study are explicit and implicit. Explicit biases are conscious stereotyping while implicit biases are hidden or unconscious. Managers are progressively concerned with implicit biases because these biases affect employees in social groups beyond the protected groups known by law. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Implicit biases has an enormous influence over organizational behaviors and decisions, which hinder the  organization's efforts, leading to isolation, exclusion, low morale, and reduced teamwork. (Jost et al., 2009). Discrimination in the workplace can be assumed in different ways, such as, the presumption that women are not as strong as men (Cognitive stereotype), expressing negative attitudes about women employed in construction (Emotional prejudice) and preference for racial attachment (racism). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, if we are going to build an equitable and just society, we must create an organization in which everyone regardless of sex or race can have access to their fair measure of success. In order to achieve this goal, individual employee/ or employer should endeavor to reduce their unconscious bias. The question is, how can bias be reduced? Here are six strategies by which individual employer or employee can remove or reduce unconscious bias in the workplace;
                </p>
                <p>
                    1.	 As individual employers who are aware of biases and are willing to create equitable society, bias can reduced through thoughtful reflection, open discussion, and appropriate use of information to significantly improve organizational decision and action (Baserman, 1998).
                </p>
                <p>
                    2.	To reduce implicit bias in the workplace managers should be trained, strengthened, and compensated. By addressing implicit bias, managers can engage the talents of all employees, by improving business performance, workplace environment, and employee satisfaction and retention (Ernst & Young, 2013).
                </p>
                <p>
                    3.	Ensure that anonymous employee assessments are conducted company-wide to understand what specific issues of hidden bias and unfairness might exist at your workplace. Each department or location may have different issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4.	As a manager, you need to initiate a resume study within your company or department to see whether resumes with roughly equivalent education and experience are rated equally, if the names are gender or race distinct. You can launch a resume study within your company to reassign points based on received accomplishments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    5.	Employers can collaborate and support with effective programs that increase diversity in the company’s decision and also reward employees who volunteer with these groups, create internships and celebrate the success of those who overcome obstacles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the documentary (recorded video), bias is evident in the medical field. There are evidences of stereotype in what the Physicians do which are based on uncultured processes, by responding to patient based on their knowledge on the field, perception and body languages devoid of due procedure. However, with the ongoing study proposed in the field embarked with the aim of preventing the detrimental effect of race or stereotype in white medical school on black students, outcome will assist in this regards.
