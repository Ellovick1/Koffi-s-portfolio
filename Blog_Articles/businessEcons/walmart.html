                <p>
                    Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) is a multinational retail consortium based in the US and having control over strings of storerooms and discount outlets. As a significant alliance, Wal-Mart has a record of over eleven thousand stores in over twenty-eight nations. Globally, it is the largest firm by revenue size. Not only does it lead the industry by revenue, but it also has the highest labor force worldwide; a whopping 2.2 million employees. It has invested considerably in its employees, review their incomes upwardly and offer welfare packages to same-sex couples. Despite these laudable strides, its share price continues to dip. To the promoters, Wal-Mart has struggled continuously the S&P 500 in the past years. For the undecided investors, here are a few reasons you should consider Wal-Mart as an investment option.
                </p>
                <h5>Reasons why you should consider investing in Wal-Mart?</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Brand Name and Consistency:</b> Undoubtedly, Wal-Mart is a brand with a striking identity to investors. Based on the operational and management dimension, the investor is much guaranteed to have their expectations met. It is a retail giant that detects, affects market trends and plays the lead role in revenue. In the past 20years, it has declared increasing profit and earnings for every shareholder. Year on year, Wal-Mart has recorded growth in earnings to about 10% yearly. Projections are that it will maintain this trajectory over the course of 5 to 7years. Owing to these predictions, it thus appears to be an alliance with a long term positive investment hub.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Wise Capital Management:</b> Amazingly, Wal-Mart has consistently increased profits and earnings through shrewd investment and re-investment scheme and has returned handsomely to its shareholders. In the past years, the firm has plowed back billions of dollars from its business balance sheet, reimburse dividends and purchase again about 30 billion dollars’ worth of shares. Wal-Mart has a historical record for doubling profits payable to the investor. For investors yet to enjoy this advantage, the company expect to pay amounts in dividends; higher than industry threshold. It has about ten billion in cash and short term projects; a good signal for even higher returns despite its plunge in stock value.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Anchoring on Innovation:</b> The firm is a pillar to reckon with in the industry. It continuously innovates and seeks new ways of improving performance and revenue. Wal-Mart has developed new technologies including “scan and go” as well as apps in the Apple App Store. Built with the objective of increasing customer satisfaction, and improving the shopping experience, the app has made day to day business more efficient. The firm now embarks on the e-commerce strategy and kicking in competitors such as e-bay and Amazon. It is examining the online pickup lockers strategy as well. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Global Business Enlargement:</b> In the past years, new markets have been achieved, and gains from extensive expansion witnessed. Since 2000, turn over from the South Asian nation has surged three times its amount. The same has been the case for East Asian economies. Not only is growth registered through developing new frontiers the only benefits it derives from expansion, but shocks and negative performance are also shielded during economic distress.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>The Green Option:</b> Wal-Mart does not focus on one area to improve sales. It should be applauded for undertaking a more escalating business outlook especially regarding green alternative; it has ventured into projects aimed at maintaining, conserving and sustaining the integrity of the business environment. A few of such decisions undertaken by Wal-Mart include; the plan to slow down sales of hazardous chemicals by about 10% by 2022 and the decision to join the Chemical Footprint Project Survey which aims at reducing the use of harmful chemicals. Furthermore, the firm is one of the most substantial business level solar panel installers and users. It desires to run totally on renewable energy in the coming years; an ideal option for the environment and business.
