            Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies, a Case of USA
            </h4>
          <h5 class="text-center">Abstract</h5>
          <p>
            Artificial intelligence and machine learning has strong ability to change the way government agencies do their task. Fast growth in Artificial Intelligence implies decrease in the cost in governance and its functions, Enhanced decision making, and quality in all administrative data released, thereby making the performances by government very efficient.  Agencies that adopts and utilize Artificial Intelligence to access these benefits will also face vital questions bordering on the algorithm design between the private and public institution with capacities to use AI and issues bordering on their permission to use AI as well. All these are essential issues for public discuss. However, very little information is known about the use of Artificial intelligence in administrative agencies. Information on how agencies use such tools is lacking. In a bit to breach these gaps, this study ensued. The report gives a presents use of artificial intelligence in few administrative agencies. Following in-depth thematic analysis of some institution, these analyses yielded five major findings. First, the government has a wide application of Artificial Intelligence toolkit traversing the federal administrative and state. Almost half of the federal agencies evaluated (45%) has used AI and associated machine learning (ML) tools. Also, AI tools are already enhancing agency strategies in  the full span of governance responsibilities, such as keeping regulatory assignments bordering on market efficiency, safety in workplace, health care, and protection of the environmental, protecting the privileges and benefits of the government ranging from intellectual properties to disability, accessing, verifying and analyzing all risks to public  safety and health, Extracting essential data from the data stream of government including complaints by consumer and the communicating with citizens on their rights, welfare, asylum seeking and business ownership. AI toolkit owned by government span the complete scope of Artificial Intelligence techniques, ranging from conventional machine learning to deep learning including natural language and image data. Irrespective of huge acceptance of AI, much still has to be done in this area by the government.

                Introduction
            </h5>
            <p>
                Aside promoting the unity and defense of the United States, the American citizen trusts the federal government to provide and enhanced welfare, preserve the environment, improve public health, provide enabling environment for innovation, and institutes employment and labor standards. The Federal agencies consistently set new guides and rules and adjudicate, implement, and otherwise effect statutory policies. As they do this, they encounter changing social, economic, and technological context. The surging sophistication of and need of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) is among the most essential national changes that have been available to the federal agencies in the past years. A lot of commentators and scholars have given foresight on how government would regulate Artificial Intelligence,

            <p>
                There is little or no information on the use of artificial intelligence by government agencies. Having a holistic idea of such application today is important for the promotion of a national Artificial Intelligence strategy that can assist in guiding the approach of the future of AI, for contemporary public sector, and for effecting adequate measures to use artificial intelligence. In the recently promulgated Artificial Intelligence in government Act, for example, seeks to “improve the use of AI across the federal government by providing access to technical expertise and streamlining hiring within the agencies.” However, AI is yet to gain full acceptance as the discuss bordering on its emergence in government continue to surface.  Most controversial AI continue to face resistance. This is evident in the number of jurisdiction filled to stop the application of facial recognition systems.
