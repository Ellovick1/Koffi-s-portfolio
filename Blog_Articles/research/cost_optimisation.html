            Cost Optimization at Early Stages of Design Using Deep Reinforcement Learning
            </h4>
          <h5 class="text-center">Abstract</h5>
          <p>
            There has unarguably been an increase in how complex modern systems are when it comes to Chips (SoCs). This, coupled with the rising demand for a time-to-market provision lower than usual, automation assumes an ultimately essential component in designing hardware. As a matter of particular relevance, this comes in handy for tasks that are time-consuming or overly complex in nature. By optimizing the cost of design for any hardware component, automation becomes an effective reality. In fact, design cost can be reliant on a number of objectives, in semblance to the trade-off between the hardware and the software. Because this task can often be multiplexed, the designer in charge will have little to no means of delivering timely and efficient optimization for the even larger and more compound models. This paper initially demonstrates that the DRL is an ideal solution for the problem encountered in this process. Thereafter, using a Pointer Network, which is a system of neural elements painstakingly tailored to play a role in the application of combinatorial complexities, we measure a trio of DRL algorithms against a specified challenge. The outcomes realized in the many cases showcased the developments that have occured by the said DRL algorithms in comparison to traditional models for optimization. Furthermore, through the use of reward re-dispensation suggested in the recently published RUDDER technique, the paper garners substantial betterments on the part of complex designs. Herein, the average optimization obtained is 15.18 percent area-wise. On the application size, the average is 8.25 percent, while being 8.12 percent on the executive time. This happens with industrial hardware-cum-software interface design data sets.

                Introduction
            </h5>
            <p>
                The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been brought on by the significant progress of computer networks as well as hardware. However, as Moore’s Law and Dennard scaling to an end, the glove is now experiencing a significant shift towards specifically tailored hardware in order to meet Artificial Intelligence’s exponentially increasing demand for computer systems. Be that as it may, the chip designs of today tend to take years to come up with. That brings us to the speculative task that is the optimization for machine learning models of the next 2 to 5 years. When the design of a chip has a substantially shortened cycle, it would be possible for the hardware to adapt more rapidly to the equally rapidly developing field of Artificial Intelligence. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In this research, it is our belief that Artificial Intelligence, by itself, will provide the means through which the cycle of a chip design can be truncated. That puts the hardware and Artificial Intelligence in symbiotic relations with each other, thus turbocharging the advances on the latter. With this paper, we introduce a training-based method for placing chips, which happens to be one of the most complicated and time-consuming processes in designing chips. Placing a netlist macros graph like the SRAMs and standard cells—logic gates like NAND, XOR, and NOR—onto the canvas of a chip in such a manner that the power, performance and area (PPA) will be optimized (Shahookar Mazumder, 1991). That will occur while obeying the ramifications that exist around the density of placement and routing congestion.

                It is quite important to improve on how optimizers off the shelf perform, mostly for the time-challenges optimization drawbacks. Case in point, the LMA algorithm (M. Pollefeys et al., 1996) has become a popular choice for a good number of real-time computer vision challenges (. That includes tracking objects using video enablers—where only a small amount of time can be allocated to the optimizer on every emerging frame of video. In fact, time-limited optimization has become an increasingly critical problem when it comes to applications like machine perception, operations research and robotics.
