            Ultra-high resolution and weakly labeled Histopathological Images in whole slide images (WSI)

          <p>
            Histological diagnostics and classification of basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) has shown great advancement in cancer diagnosis and are essential for the percentage proportion assessment of the of particular histological groups, risk determination of the recurrence of this illness, and comparison of treatment results. The diagnosis of basal cell carcinomas (BCC), one of the most common cutaneous malignancies, is a regular task performed by pathologists. Improving histological diagnosis by providing diagnosis suggestions through computer-assisted diagnoses is highly active in areas of research to improve safety, quality and efficiency. Machine learning methods are increasingly being applied in diagnosis due to their superior performance. However, typical images obtained by scanning histological sections often have a resolution that is not suitable for current state of-the-art neural networks. Furthermore, network training is complicated by weak labels, because only a tiny fraction of the image indicates the disease class, whereas a large fraction of the image is highly similar to the non-disease class. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether it is possible to detect basal cell carcinomas in histological sections using attention-based deep learning models and to overcome the ultra-high resolution and the weak labels of whole slide images. We demonstrate that attention-based models can indeed yield almost perfect classification performance with an AUC of 0.97.

                Introduction
            </h5>
            <p>
                Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) represent one of the most common cutaneous malignancies in humans (Chinem and Miot, 2011). Because of their frequency, BCCs are diagnosed by pathologists and dermato-pathologists on a regular basis. Digital pathology improves and simplifies histological diagnoses with regard to safety, quality and efficiency (Griffin and Treanor, 2017). Digital pathology improves diagnoses of pathologists by providing diagnostic support, namely computer-assisted diagnoses (Komura and Ishikawa, 2018). Recently this is mainly achieved using machine learning methods. Such methods could assist physicians, particularly pathologists in finding new histological patterns for the diagnosis of diseases.

                Most authors use two basic criteria in the creation of classifications of histological types, the histological growth pattern and histological differentiation. Most authors agree that the histological growth pattern is of the greatest biological significance. Classification based on the histological growth pattern is useful during the creation of the concept of low-risk and high-risk types of BCC (Boulinguez et al; 2004). A greater probability of subclinical spread, aggressive local behaviour of the tumour with a more frequent occurrence of local recurrences and incomplete excision are characteristic of high-risk types (Weedon and Strutton, 2002; Saldanha et al., 2003). High-risk types include infiltrative (Figure 1, Figure 2) and superficial types; a representative of the low-risk type of BCC is the nodular type, in which many histological variants were described (Saldanha et al., 2003). The criterion of cell differentiation obtained less support for classification. The significance of the squamous differentiation of BCC is controversial. There is no accord of views regarding the type of basosquamous carcinoma. This type is most frequently described as the simultaneous presence of basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma (Rosai, 2004); some authors report further items, keratotic carcinoma (Weedon and Strutton, 2002) and metatypical carcinoma (Weedon and Strutton, 2002). Regardless of this unclear definition, some authors expressed the opinion that BCC associated with moderate or severe squamous cell atypia or malignity is associated with a higher occurrence of local recurrences and metastatic spread (Weedon and Strutton, 2002; Saldanha et al., 2003). In BCC with follicular differentiation there are usually less squamous cell atypias, however with no significance for the biological behaviour of the tumour (Saldanha et al., 2003). The classification by Sexton (1990) and Rippey (1998) does not include the variants with squamous cell differentiation as special types of BCC. Many BCC contain more histological types and there is no consent from what percentage of individual types the BCC should be determined as a new histological variant. Scant attention was paid to the evaluation of the growth pattern in the invading part of the tumour or in its border areas (Sexton et al., 1990). There are no studies dealing with the reproducibility of the histological findings; there are only a few studies dealing with the description of the size of the protective rim of the excised tumour.
