            Impact of Artificial Intelligence, Robotics and Automation Technologies on Work
            <h5 class="text-center">Abstract</h5>
          <p>
            Is it possible that artificial intelligence, work place robots and automation could be a serious threat to work? Robots, automation and artificial intelligence are beginning to enter many places of work and are getting involved in a number of task. With the understanding on the role that work has in the lives of many, becoming redundant consequent of application of machine in workplace may imply a threat to having a meaningful life. It becomes even more devastating when re-assigned roles no longer seem interesting or meaningful consequent on the emergence of robotics and artificial intelligence. The current therefore sought to provide direction on the subject. It investigated the variations that artificial intelligence, robotics and automation has on work. To do this, the study sampled about 120 respondents working in public and private firms and adopted the Paired Sample T-test to compare the impact of artificial intelligence, robotics and automation on work. It sought to answer the question; is there a significant increase in work output of AI, robotics and automation based task”. The evaluation was done with the scores of work output compared at two periods; “before automation” and “after automation”. There was a significant increase in the work output scores from (M = 7.793, SD = 1.2567) before automation to (M = 16.7, SD = 1.60) after automation; t (120) = -50.940, p< 0.05 (two –tailed). Conclusively, AI, robotics and automation has a positive impact on work. New technologies will complement rather than substitute humans. Therefore, as recommendation, there is the need for professionals in society to gain some form of information technology skills to maximize the benefits from the use of AI, robotics and automation.

                Introduction
            </h5>
            <p>
                Tim Reek is one of the numerous employees whose routine work- in his case arranging and piling plastic in his company- has been given out to a robot. Luckily for Tim, this did not imply that he had to look elsewhere for another job. Rather, he currently supervises the robotic arms as it piles up the bins, ensuring that everything moves smoothly, and arresting situations where necessary. He found his former job boring and physically exhausting. His new jobs, for which Tim got extra training, are non-routine and mentally exercising (Wingfield 2017). In his new assignment, Tim has much higher responsibility, and he discharges her capabilities for comprehension and decision-making to a greater extent. His new assignment and how he handles them now makes all the difference to the running of the warehouse than it was before. It looks as though Tim’s job has is now given more meaning since the introduction of robots to work side by side with him.

                At the same time, it is possible, however, that work place robots could be a serious threat to work. For instance; the introduction of self-driving metros saw the task of metro drivers in Paris given in parts to the robots. A few fortunate metro drivers were given optional roles as managers while some others lost their jobs. The new responsibility re-assigned to the fortunate ones were non-repetitive, non-exciting, and non-stimulating. However, a survey carried on metro drivers turned managers showed that they felt deprived of meaningful duty. Rather than take full responsibility of their work, they only responded in situation of emergency. Moreover, that they were not directly responsible for the safety of travelers anymore implied that the metro drivers certainly felt a loss of duty in their new assignments (Anteby and Nishani 2016).  This shows that work can also, loss its meaning post robots introduction.
