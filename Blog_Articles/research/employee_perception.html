            Employees’ Perceptions of the Implementation of Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, and Automation (RAIA) on Job Security, Job Satisfaction, and Employability
            </h4>
          <h5 class="text-center">Abstract</h5>
          <p>
            Do technology cause job losses? Though it is a popular believe, it does, not all business leader considers it this way. The opinion that the traditional approach to jobs will be eliminated for contemporary ones’ consequence on the arrival of artificial intelligence, robotics, internet of things, automation, and technology differs from sector to sector. Computer are becoming smarter, creative and sophisticated hence; making previous roles out of model or fashion. These desires have made workplace develop dependency on robotics, artificial intelligence, and automation (RAIA) system. Many studies have expressed the concern that RAIA may can turn out so advanced that aside from displacing humans in the place of work, it will become so complex in such a way that humans won’t be able to control. The current study attempt to address this concern. It provides answers to the question “what is the impact of RAIA on current job satisfaction, job security, and employability? It adopted the cross-sectional research data collection and exploratory design to analyze its objective. About 50 respondents were drawn from the researchers personal, and professional network. The participants are all working class adults from various firms and from different sector. Overview of thematic process suggest that the impacts of RAIA is not detrimental. It is not meant to substitute human but to complement. The thematic analysis also provides other findings for firms and government as detailed in the study result presented section four. Following this result, the study proposes that irrespective of the unforeseen risk of robotics, artificial intelligence, and automation, jobs are secured. Employees should keep evolving with technology to remain employable.

                Introduction
            </h5>
            <p>
                Earlier studies by Bowen (1966) opined that technology causes job losses and not work. Though it is a popular believe, not all business leader considers it this way. The opinion that the traditional approach to jobs will be eliminated for contemporary ones’ consequence on the arrival of artificial intelligence, robotics, the internet of things, automation, and technology differs from sector to sector (Ivanov 2017). Computer are becoming smarter, creative and sophisticated hence; making previous roles out of model or fashion (West 2015). According to Webster and Ivanov (2019), businesses desire that their cost of production be kept low, they need increasing speed of production, consistency in production and quality of products output and supply chains. These desires have made them develop dependency on robotics, artificial intelligence, and automation (RAIA) system.

                The adoption of RAIA commenced in the manufacturing sector and later spread to different areas of the society as well as the economy (Webster and Ivanov 2019). Presently, the group of workers that appear not to be afraid of RAIA technologies in the place of work are professionals, managers and the highly literate workers in comparison with those who are manual, les educated, employees. However, studies show that RAIA do have an effect on most task in the workplace (Dekker et al. 2017).  Many studies have expressed the concern that RAIA may can turn out so advanced that aside from displacing humans in the place of work, it will become so complex in such a way that humans won’t be able to control (Fast and Horvitz 2017). For instance, Castelvecchi (2016) opines that during the 1990s, Artificial Intelligence was thought of as a black box that could not be fully controlled nor understood. Humans and Artificial Intelligence will have to complement each other and work hand in gloves. This underscores the importance and need to employing people with requisite skills that would be complementary to technologies (Plastino and Purdy 2018). Certainly, when comes to with job security, RAIA technologies poses concern to workers.

                Submerged in a database of combined data shown to be operative for identifying restrained relationships or patterns. This manner of learning is categorized under supervised learning. Incorporation algorithms consist of the K-nearest, K-Mean, Sorting map, and other algorithms (Hwang, 2019). These algorithms do not require prior knowledge of the data but are capable to detect classes in them by recurrently equating response models, as long as stationary capacity in training instances is accomplished according to subject matter or procedure. Each group of data projects very close resemblances, on the other hand, vary immensely from the data opinions of other sets. Incorporation has immense uses in model detection, image testing, and bioinformatics, and the likes (Vaishali and Rupa. 2011).
