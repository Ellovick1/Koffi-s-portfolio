        <h4 class="text-center">How Will Robots Affect the World in the Future?</h4>
        <h5 class="text-center">1.0 Introduction</h5>
           
        <p>
            The nexus between technology and our daily living, today and the future continue to evolve. The great innovative waves which accompanies it makes humans optimistic and at the same time, heightens fears (González Vázquez et al. 2019). Historically, automation often presents adantages and disadvantages.  With current applications and wide usage, it is therefore necessary to examine its effects to the world and future. One of such technology is Robotics. 
        </p>

        <p>
            A Robot is an independent machine that is skilled in detecting its surroundings, performing computations by making a decision, and carrying out activities in real-time as the programme by a computer. From the above definition, it is clear that robots operates based on the programmable design. In other words, it operates according to” programmable by a computer”. It uses a set of sensors that enable it to sense its environment as well as performing a complex task. Robots are categorized according to the setting or environment, in which they operate. The most general forms of robots are, fixed and mobile robots and they operate in different working environments as well as requiring diverse capabilities. Fixed robots are generally used in an industrial environment because this set of robots can only carry out their task in well-defined settings. They carry out particular and repetitive tasks such as painting or soldering in a manufacturing plant (Georg and Guy Michaels, 2015).
        </p>
        <p>
            With the recent advancement of devices and sensors for human-robot interaction, the robot can be employed in a supervised environment that requires high precision. Contrarily, mobile robots are usually seen everywhere performing one task or the other in both conventional and ill-defined environments. For decades now, the dramatic increase of the international standard of industrial robots and has been estimated to drastically increase shortly, owing to what is going on in China’s pace of setting up. Robotics manufacturing has witnessed radical investment progress, overturning decades-long drifts of continuing and balanced growth. A meeting of modernisms in digital pieces of knowledge such as machine learning and artificial intelligence alongside developments in robotics production and energy storage is radically converting the abilities of robots. The emergence of automation offers substantial prospects for businesses to increase productivity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Similarly, Antecol and Cobb-Clark (2009) reported an increasing dissatisfaction in the US military. The study opined that racial bias was responsible for high turnover in the military. Since 1981, data availability have improved, hence the current study takes a step further to verify racial discrepancy among employees. Unlike earlier study which investigated job satisfaction base on gender and older males, current study investigates the relationship for both sexes and all ages above 18 years.

            In the light of new evidences, opinions and concerns, this paper poses the following questions; How are modern day robots influencing our living? Do they posse threats to the future? Will robots transform our stlye of work? Are the socio-economic effects we should be weary? What are the driving factors of these technology? These questions have been with us and has remain seriously debatable. This paper therefore seeks to address these concerns with relations to robots and its application in the preceding sections.
