            <h4>Effect of Stock Market on Consumption; the Impact of Recession</h4>
            <h5 class="text-center">1.0 Introduction</h5>
            <p>
                Decrease in level of household consumption, slower businesses, weakening sales and production are some noticeable features of recession. Often, stock prices are often low as investors tend to be risk averse during this period. However, macro economic detects that periods of abundance follow recession. Discussions on the behavior of macroeconomic variables including income, interest rates, household consumption and stock market are often the central theme of this period (Keynes, 1936). Keynes (1936) argued that market signals from assets to the real sector, especially as it relates to these variables do come with varied level of implications. This paper furthers the discussion on the subject for the consumption stock market relation for the pre and post recession.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the U.S, stockholdings represent a significant proportion of financial assets on householdsâ€™ wealth. Agarwal, and Qian (2014) opined that aggregate stock holdings by household is over $32 trillion, a figure which is significant when compared to the aggregate housing wealth. With this level of prominence, one would presume that stock price volatility at any given economic outlook; whether in recession or abundance may have significant influence on household saving and consumption level. However, for instance, Cieslak and Vissing Jorgensen, (2017) reported a dip in household saving rate and stock prices during periods of recession hence concluded that lower investment decreased consumption during recession. Poterba (2000) and Iacoviello (2011) also reported housing and stock markets as major sources of household income. Both studies concluded that growing financial and housing assets are most likely to induce consumption. Would the stock market consumption relationship remain same during period of economic recession and abundance? Apparently, this paper addresses three complementary sets of
                questions. Are there noticeable inequalities consequent upon activities of the stock market on household consumption level? To what extent did the pre and post--recession stock market rally affect aggregate consumption? What are the additional variables to explain consumption?
            </p>
            <p>
                Conversely, there is the need to have an understanding of the quantum of decline in aggregate consumption to expect if stock prices assume a sudden turn as it was the case during past recessions. The study also evaluates the relationship between consumption and some macroeconomic variable, including income, and interest rates. The remainder of the paper is structured in sections as follows: literature review in 2, methodology in 3, analysis and result in 4, discussions in 5 while recommendation is in 6.
