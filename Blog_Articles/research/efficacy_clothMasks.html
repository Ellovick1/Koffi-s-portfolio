        <h4>Efficacy of Cloth Masks in Controlling Aerosol Particle Emission and Protection against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome- Coronavirus 2</h4>
        <h5 class="text-center">1.0 Introduction</h5>
            <p>
                SARS-CoV-2 infection is transmitted mainly by respiratory droplets produced when people sneeze, cough, sing, breathe or talk. Emerging evidences shows that cloth masks could be effective in protecting the wearer from contacting respiratory infections the in community and healthcare setting. Similarly, it reduces emission and breaks transmission of the infection laden droplets from asymptomatic infected users who are unaware of their infection status and how risky they are to others. CDC advises on the use of cloth mask, particularly; the non-valved many layered cloth mask. They are a economical, simple and are a sustainable option to the use of surgical mask as a way of controling the SARS-CoV-2. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Compared to respirators and medical masks, the filtration capacity of masks is generally low; however, cloth masks may give some protection when properly used and designed. They should be designed to sit properly on the face. Water resistance cloth material with dense, finely weaved, compactly threaded, and with many layers offers an appreciable protection. Since cloth masks are not proven to possess same effectiveness as the N95 or medical mask, their usage in the hospitals by healthcare workers are not compulsory. However, in the community settings, they may be effective in preventing the transmission of infections by the asymptomatic and sick and infected persons.
            </p>
            <p>
                Consequence on the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, there is a global shortage and limited number of medical supplies including medical respirators and masks. Basically, respirators and surgical masks are used as protection against infections and respiratory infections. The difference in these products lies in the intention of usage. While respirators are mainly worn by health workers to give protection during respiration, the medical masks are used to protect from droplet infections, splashes, sprays of blood and body fluids in both healthcare and community settings. They are also worn to stop transmission from sick or asymptomatic persons termed as source control. 
            </p>
            <p>
                However, high level discussions are ongoing on the use of cloth masks as COVID-19 prevention, control and transmission tools in the community. Research on the use of cloth masks were performed in vivo and during the first half of the 20th century, prior to the design and production of medical masks. Following the severity of the current pandermic, this study will advance the discussion on the subject. To thise end this study will provide answer to the following questions; Are cloth face mask likely to protect against respiratory viral infections including COVID 19? Are there factors to be considered when using cloths mask? Is there a significant different between the use of cloth face mask and medical facemask ?
