                <h2 class="text-center">A Pretty Kenny Autobiography</h2>
                <p>Kenneth Johnson a.k.a Pretty Kenny is an Oakland, CA base music legend. Though he is a business scholar by profession, his rhythmic mix has won him more heart than the board room. Inspired by his parents' eclectic flare in southern soul  & blues music, coupled with his early admiration and love for this art, Kenny grew fascinated and became allured to music. His sublimed debut into his new found love dates back 1972, at aged 5. With a convincing knowledge and well-articulated background, he learned the ways of the blues music, self-studied and developed an in-depth understanding of it. At age 7, he had already taken voice lessons, played the drums, and mastered the piano. Young Kenny steadily settled into life as a Musician.</p>
                <p>Soon, Kenny could register his presence in talent shows and performed on mini production stages, playing his tunes, relating to everyone within his reach and exhilarating the dance floor. As a young man; quite passionate about learning new techniques and growing in it, he joined the sexy dancers, a famous high school troupe back in the early 80s where he dazzled the fans with his electrifying dance moves. After high school, he entered the military, met new friends, and formed a group of 4 rap singers known as, the Brothers for Brothers (BFB). The group featured works of several artists including RUN-DMC, Whodini, EPMD and Brenda K. Starr at the time.</p>
                <p>Away from the Military, Kenny went on to align with six others to form a group called the Pretty Kenny & the Funky Blues. His love and attention in the niche launched him to the next level. Soon, he became more enrooted in his chosen niche, a beautiful style from his old fanatics; Tyrone Davis, Johnny Taylor, and his favorite, Johnny Guitar Watson. In what is considered by many as clever wordplay,  climaxed with plenty of innuendo like those of his idols, Pretty Kenny laced his songs. Following his early success as a Music pundit, Kenny launched into offering guidance and tutelage to young minds interested in the art. He began to manage artists and promote parties in Oakland and San Francisco under 7Broke Brothers Entertainment and later 4712 Music.</p>
                <p>As an icon, he is worthy of veneration, his musical selection flusters other Artist. Kenny plays the blues to all people, electrifying the dance hall with his showmanship, and crowd commanding performance. Though he loves playing in parties, nightclubs, and special events, his love for music goes beyond just mixing tunes but borne from life's ups and downs including romance, relationship, heartbreaks, and sexual contents.  He has found plenty of ways to display his talent. For him, it is all about the beats; rocking those tracks that make you tap your feet and nod your head notwithstanding your style. He bases his craft on a principle of “Let us in, and we’ll turn it out”; a lesson he teaches to all.  Kenny, a business-oriented graduate turn Musician, desires to storm the industry and tour the world with his musical show in the nearest future.</p>
