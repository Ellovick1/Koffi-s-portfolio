                <h2>DIVORCE, ANNULMENTS, AND DISSOLUTION OF CIVIL UNIONS</h2>
                <p>Often, circumstance ensues among partners such that it leads to breaking up. Ending a relationship cannot just happen without applying for dissolution.  Two options are available to the partners; Annulment or Divorce. Although these options are different, both possess similar features. By law, the difference between the two lies in the requirements and condition to be fulfilled before a divorce or annulment is obtained and the obligation expected to be discharged by either party post-separation. Religious bodies have attempted to define divorce and annulment. However, court ruling may vary from religious expectations. </p>
                <h3>Definitions of Divorce and Annulment</h3>
                <p>Annulment and divorce differ from each other in a sense that; a divorce terminates a legal marriage while annulment officially pronounces that the marriage was illegal. A divorce is the dissolution or termination of a legal marriage according to the dictates of the law. It brings to end a legal marriage; thus declaring the partners involved as single. An Annulment, on the other hand, is a legal ruling that brings to end a marriage by announcing or proclaiming such union as void and invalid. This implies that the relationship was illegal. It is essential to understand that an annulment made by religious bodies is not a valid dissolution of civil marriage. </p>
                <h3>The Rationale for seeking an Annulment or a Divorce</h3>
                <p>Various rationales exist for seeking a divorce or filing for an annulment. Either of the spouses may decide to call quit with the union. Marriage dissolution by divorce is typical and sought when both partners agree that there was a union in the first place. Annulment becomes imperative when a partner or both admit or recognize that there was something legally faulty about the union from the beginning. </p>
                <h3>The Rationale for seeking a Divorce</h3>
                <p>Different states have their laws concerning divorce. So, depending on state laws, proof may be required before a court permits a separation. However, a no-fault divorce is becoming widespread and common. Depending on the divorce type, partners may terminate the union and agree to contest ownership or possession of finances, properties, child custody, alimony, and many other issues in the court. </p>
                <h3>The legal conditions and implication for divorce: </h3>
                <h5>
                a)	No-Fault Divorce </h5>

                <p>In a no-fault divorce, the law allows a spouse to move for a divorce without accusing the other spouse of the termination. Incompatibility, irremediable and conflicting differences and above all; a breakdown or loss of affection, are some grounds for filing a no-fault divorce. </p>
                <h5>

                b)	Fault-Based Divorce </h5>

                <p>Like the no-fault divorce, some states permit a spouse to secure a fault-based divorce. Reasons for seeking a divorce may include one or many of the following: adultery, domestic violence, drug and alcohol, family abandonment. The decision to opt for a fault-based divorce may be to avoid the required waiting period or to influence the court's judgment as to child custody, support, asset sharing, and alimony. </p>
                <h3>The Rationale for seeking an Annulment </h3>
                <p>A union is terminated by an annulment when at least one of the partners is of the view that the marriage was illegal and shouldn’t have been in existence in the first place. If the marriage was consequent on unknown specifics including a secret child or illness, then there are chances that such a union could be declared null. Concerns including those arising from bigamy or incest could render the union illegal thus; triggers the annulment moves for, such a union. </p>
                <p>In the United States, the laws guiding marriage annulment differs from state to state. Even though the reasons for seeking an annulment vary, there is a common ground for annulment: </p>
                <p>
                a)	Close relative marriage- Marriages between relatives are proscribed. Marriages between siblings,  a parent, and a child, grandparent, and grandchild, and or unions between first cousins. </p>
                <p>
                b)	Fraud- A spouse or both partners are deceived into marriage, by misrepresentation or concealment of vital information, including criminal record, pregnancy by another spouse, legal tussle, illness, life-threatening diseases including sexually transmitted disease. </p>
                <p>
                c)	If either or both partner did not attain the age stipulated by the law at the time, it took place. One or both partners are below the legal age to marry; then the union is subject to being annulled</p>
                <p>
                d)	If either or both partner entered the marriage due to threats or force; he/she may later seek an annulment</p>
                <p>
                e)	If either or both partners was legally married to another at the time </p>
                <p>
                f)	If either or both partners are unable to discharge his/her sexual obligations in the marriage</p>
                <h3>What happens in the event of a divorce or an annulment, what next? </h3>
                <p>According to legal pundits; one other differing opinion between the two marriage dissolution types is the fact that a union is never considered to have legally occurred post annulment. Duane L. Coker of CokerLegal commented in what is the Difference Between an Annulment and a Divorce? That an annulment essentially turns back the time so that the act of marriage never happened," she concluded. In a related exposition, Attorney, Lina Guillen, from Lawyers.com, also documented post-dissolution circumstances in Can This Marriage be Annulled?  An advantage which dissolution of the union by annulment conveyed is the fact that; in the eye of the law; the union never was in existence. It is deemed over, and as such there are no concerns for worries including a contest for properties or compensation. Seemingly, unlike annulment, divorce implies or connotes continuous connection with an ex-partner even for many years to come. Concerns including support, alimony, property contest, child or children raising, are some issues which may keep the connection between the two. Annulment is not an option for everyone. Only a few proportions of the married qualify for it. </p>
                <h3>Finances</h3>
                <p>A move for spousal support up to a certain number of years after a divorce is often initiated.  Partners are also entitled to alimony, a proportion of business profit, and interest while all assets acquired as at the time of the union is often shared. Unlike the divorce, the case cannot be said for an annulment. Parties are not entitled to similar rights. This is because the partners were not legally married in the first place. In Annulment vs. Divorce: The Financial Differences, there is clear cut reasoning, "When it comes to finances, the difference is obvious.  According to the law, partners in annulled marriages are only restored to their initial financial status before the union. </p>
                <h3>Length of Time of the Marriage</h3>
                <p>Most times, people conceptualize a short duration as a pre-condition for an annulment. By implication, a marriage which lasted briefly qualifies for annulment. However, Legal pundits think otherwise. For some states, a maximum number of years is stated; after which an annulment is denied. Proclaiming or seeking dissolution by annulment because the couple desires to end the union shortly after its institution is invalid. In Common Questions and Misconceptions About Divorce, Monica Cameron highlighted the condition for an annulment to include instituting the marriage under duress, falsehood, mental ill-health, fraud, criminality bigamy, or incest. The length, period or duration of the union as a condition for annulment is inconsequential</p>
                <h3>Legal Assistance</h3>
                <p>Undoubtedly, from the legal point of view, irrespective of the type of dissolution; whether annulment or divorce, the intricacies could be complicated, involving lengthy legal proceedings, and a high-cost implication. On the flip side, either of the two options of marriage dissolution could be low cost or easy if both partners decide to terminate the marriage without bringing much controversy or friction into the process. </p>
                <h3>Religious Rules</h3>
                <p>Religious implications, guidelines, and interpretation of marriage terminations by annulment or divorce exist. Sometimes, permission is granted through formal guidelines by a Clergy. Securing approval from clergy to initiate an annulment or a divorce is different and separate from a legal proceeding. Whether or not the parties who have ventured into dissolution will commune or take parts in religious rites after such dissolution is often a subject of discussion in the religion parlance. Partner’s religious marital status may be taken into consideration by a court, but their resolutions concerning the termination are not considered during rulings in issues of alimony, child support, disputes or other concern ensues. </p>
                <h3>Comparison between annulments and divorces</h3>
                <p>The table scheduled below shows a summary comparison between the two forms of dissolution</p>

                <h3>Is it essential to secure the services of a lawyer prior to a divorce, legal separation or annulment?</h3> 
                <p>In most situations, it may not be necessary to secure the services of a lawyer prior to obtaining an annulment, a divorce, or legal separation. However, it is essential that couples consider retaining legal representation to direct them through the intricacies of alimony, child custody, spousal support, and asset sharing.</p>
