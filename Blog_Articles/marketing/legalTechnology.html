                   Law is as old as man itself, and it is the basis of human existence. From time immemorial, laws have been initiated to assist, oversee and superintend human behaviour.  The global and contemporary advancement has redefined law; partly to flow with the trend. These changes and adjustment witnessed over time are imperative if laws must continue to maintain its pride of place in the preferences of things.  With new situations, new laws are created daily to carter for them. At the moment, technology has found itself in the parlance of the law. The waves and pace of technological progress now possess a challenge to law; a severe one. Now, law needs to adapt hence the initiation of the buzz word legal technology.
               </p>

               <h5>What is Legal Technology?</h5>
               <p>Typically, legal technology is an innovation which eases the provision of law services. It is used to describe the practice of using software in law firms to assist with routine operations and management activities. The insurgence of Legal Technology came to lime light since 2011 and known to be associated with startup law firms. The goal is to discontinue the traditional practice style of law by improving and allowing people to have access to law services online, thereby reducing and obliterating the need to open communications with lawyers. In other situations, it links clients up with lawyers in manners that are more effective. </p>
               <p>Legal technology seeks to provide and present lawyers and law alliances with contemporary ways to serve the clients; a trend that has been unheard of in previous decades. Adaptability is therefore key and beneficial to lawyers in many ways; more so because clients are progressively becoming technologically inclined as well. Legal technology came to a climaxed with the amendment of Model Rules of Professional Conduct by the American Bar Association, which now specifies the need for lawyers to be tech-savvy.</p>

               <h5>Why Innovate and Why Now? </h5>
               <p>
                   <a class="text-info" href="https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fedepoze.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F09%2Flegal-tech-adoption.jpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fedepoze.com%2Fproblem-of-legal-tech-adoption%2F&docid=7RyxTDMMhDnqZM&tbnid=vosO22oQUtiJmM%3A&vet=10ahUKEwiBwozMwoXjAhV8ShUIHXfEATcQMwijAShUMFQ..i&w=1000&h=667&bih=608&biw=1366&q=legal%20technologies&ved=0ahUKEwiBwozMwoXjAhV8ShUIHXfEATcQMwijAShUMFQ&iact=mrc&uact=8">Image Credit</a><br>
                   <img style="float: left; margin-right:10px; width: 20%; height: 30%;" src="/img/tech-trend-adoption.jpg" alt="">
                   There is a burning desire to innovate. The leaders in the industry are somehow not sufficiently motivated to disrupt the age-long status-quo while clients are not just pushing just enough for a change. There is a burning question, why innovate now?  External and Internal factors within the firm exert great pressure for a transformation; one that is in line with the competition. How does the typical law firm desire to compete favourably and surge business profit using the current and Archie business model? The legal illuminants are being forced out of their comfort zones to re-align their skill portfolios. Though it seems, the legal process is slow and frustrating, the successes recorded in previous years is an attestation to the fact that operations can be made better, and changes as a result of a change can contribute positively to the baseline.
                </p>
                <p>Legal technology is a plus to Law. The understanding that a lawyer is versatile with contemporary technologies can make the whole difference and can improve the chances of getting a Lawyer hired by a client. Legal technology is an attestation that lawyers are fully dedicated to discharging their responsibilities in the best and appropriate manner and with all resources available to them. In addition to surging the client base, here are other importance of legal technology.</p>
                <ul>
                    
                <h5>1.	The role of Automation</h5>
                <p>With technology, Lawyers now have the options of choosing an appropriate tool for automating the business areas, including task, meeting scheduling, document filing, and time spent on cases, and the billing processes. The cost of hiring office assistance is drastically reduced, and time is used efficiently.</p>
                
                <h5>2.	Improve Customer Service</h5>
                <p>There is a growing need to improve clients’ satisfaction now, more than ever. Today, providing legal service has gone beyond giving a better shot but the client’s satisfaction. The customers’ needs to be happy with your services for a repeat of business; hence, clients satisfaction is paramount. Legal technology has the potential for improving clients’ satisfaction. Software’s and other useful tools assist you in reaching out to your clients to keep them engaged. With the live chat handle on your website, you can hang out with potential clients and translate them into actual customers.</p>

                <h5>3.	Makes Research Easy</h5>
                <p>Though research in law has been re-shaped by the internets, most lawyers still make use of print Media routinely. Most of these printed materials are not updated for decades. With the understanding that law is dynamic, there is always a need for continuous update. It is therefore imperative that an online legal research platform is initiated to assist lawyers in staying up to date with information which may not be provided in the print media as a result of its static characteristic.</p>

                <h5>4.	Adapting to change</h5>
                <p>Today, courts at various levels now apply an electronic court filing system. Many now envisage a time when court filings are mandatory to ease case transition. To do this, law firms and lawyers need to be conversant with litigation tools, innovation and software. </p>

                </ul>
                
                <h5>Top Innovation and Technological Trends in Legal For 2019</h5>
                <p class="text-center">
                    <img style="margin: auto; width: 50%; height: 50%;" src="/img/new-and-existing-legal-trend.jpg" src="" alt=""><br>
                    <a class="text-info" href="https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fimage.slidesharecdn.com%2Ftrendsinlegaltech2018-171122081127%2F95%2Ftrends-in-legal-tech-2018-42-638.jpg%3Fcb%3D1511339215&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.slideshare.net%2FSecurePrivacy%2Ftrends-in-legal-tech-2018-82498945&docid=MFdCTsaus8gGfM&tbnid=WPdbhwROoiGkHM%3A&vet=10ahUKEwiBwozMwoXjAhV8ShUIHXfEATcQMwigAShRMFE..i&w=638&h=359&bih=608&biw=1366&q=legal%20technologies&ved=0ahUKEwiBwozMwoXjAhV8ShUIHXfEATcQMwigAShRMFE&iact=mrc&uact=8">Image Credit</a>
                </p>
                <p>Have the stato-quo changed? Alternatively, are they still the same? Are there any major unexpected shift? Just as in other industries, the results are a mixed bag for Law as well. As observed in previous years, the legal system has been so adverse to digital transformation. There is a considerable potential in the law industry to maximize efficiency, optimizes processes, and offer new perspectives to the legal system. Scheduled below is a brief on some of the trends in law for 2019.</p>

               <ul>
                <h5>1.	Artificial Intelligence</h5>
                <p>This is considered as one of the faster surging areas of legal technology; artificial intelligence (AI). This is already evident in the adoption of computer logic, which can remove monotonicity and the brunt of administrative flaws, including the tasks which lawyers once had to utilize considerable time discharging. For instance; the difficult task of locating files, the process of reviewing of terms, and conditions are some of these tasks which AI can assist.  Artificial intelligence can classify and validate vast data at an unmatched rate leading a quicker achievement. AI can also make informed projections and forecast using an in-depth data analysis. Expectations AI will continue to expand, and gains will surge considerably.</p>

                <h5>2.	Cloud and Mobile</h5>
                <p>Consider a situation that you are in the middle of a litigation tussle. Your lawyer brings to your notice that one of the critical files which contain a statement suitable enough to hand you the desired win was left behind in the office. What would be the course of action? How would you react? Cloud and mobile services better handle events like this. These two innovations are essential since mobility demands the availability of the cloud. Hopefully, more of the cloud-based mobile is therefore anticipated for enhanced accessibility of customer’s case files, and litigation resources. In this age, people desire everything to be readily available to them on their device; the law industry inclusive.</p>

                <h5>3.	Blockchain and Security</h5>
                <p>With straddling issues and consciousness of cybersecurity, blockchain technology is fairly becoming distinguished in the legal parlance. Currently, blockchain technology is increasingly playing a role in cryptocurrency prices. Information and intelligence on the blockchain are untraceable and difficult to hack.  This is because all information in the blockchain is in chains of nodes each substantiating each other. To hack, all the nodes will have to be adjusted concurrently without which; no fraudulent activity can be performed. Aside from security, this progress will also be essential for lawyers in many other ways, including the design of contracts which law facts will be examined and cached with verified signatures and custody.</p>

                <h5>4.	Virtual Law Firms</h5>
                <p>Beyond the typical online legal services, which are the case presently, an entirely new shift is eminent; virtual law firms are ready to take center stage. The increasing demand for cloud and mobile, legal pundits, will have higher latitude as to where work is done. Virtual meetings will obliterate virtual travel time and will give higher work/life stability for the profession. Many consider this as one of the most delight transformations since it has the potential to be beneficial for the whole industry.</p>

                <h5>5.	Data Developments</h5>
                <p>In the coming days, how data is crunched, cached and utilized in the law industry will be so unprecedented. A few years back, security risk was wrapped around cloud storage and application. However, they are becoming popular and recognized as contemporary as well as the most secured technique of organizing and storing data faster. Just last year; in 2018, famous alliances such as British, Airways Facebook, and Google, almost got their reputation marred by scandals relating to data misuse, irresponsibility, or hacking. Accordingly, innovations such as multi-level authentication or verification, data encryption, watermarked records are going to surge.</p>

                <h5>6.	Contract Management</h5>
                <p>In all fronts, legal professionals handle negotiation, management, finalisation, and follow up of contracts. With the acceptance of technology, this process is soon going to change in the nearest future. Improved data storage and management processes, online designed tools for contracts will become widespread. Most practitioners are already using E-signing software, and more usage is even anticipated in the future. The whole documentation exercises ranging from a request, negotiations, approval and authorisation represent the new phase of a technological revolution.  Consequently, tools such as management templates authorising contracts executions and practices are envisaged across law firms and professionals.</p>

               </ul>
               
                <h5>The Legal Talent and the Lawyer of the Future</h5>

                </p>
                <p>
                    Less confident than not, the career path of individuals coming into the legal profession is not known, but it is quite sure that tomorrow legal industry will be different from that of today. Smart and brilliant professionals and clients consider disruptions as standard and will continue to demand innovation even if the old guys seems unmotivated to flow with the trend. A paramount question remains, in what ways can firm motivate and support the new generation lawyers?
                    What early-career professionals’ care seems different from the current leadership. How can today’s lawyer innovate? Those with secured jobs are also concerned about the chances of losing their job because of innovation.  There is a lacunar in skills among individual employees and even with those at the management level. Graduates from the law will have to equip themselves with new sets of skills to match the needs of today. Skills and tools which have increasing importance and are considered essential. These skills include the ability to collaborate with other professionals from other disciplines; business and financial; legal project management acumen; data analytics, technology literacy and data analytics. As a community, the focus of the future includes designing tools and operations which enhance high performance, assisting in achieving strategic business objectives. Disruptive technologies that allow legal professional lives better and discharge their services and horn the above mentioned skills appropriately are what is envisaged.
