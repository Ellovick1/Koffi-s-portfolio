               <h3>The Beginner's Guide to Dropshipping</h3>
               <p>Are you new to online businesses? Are you seeking to take part in e-commerce;  Dropshipping to be particular? The term could seem a bit intimidating to newbies. For these set of persons, information is paramount and identifying reliable sources aren’t that simple. This post will expound dropshipping and gives more insight into it. </p>
               <p>Drop shipping is an e-commerce strategy used by an online shopping agency or agencies to sell products to customers, but the transit of the products is from the wholesaler to the end users without going through the retailer. </p>

               <h5>Who can drop ship and how does dropshipping Work?</h5>
               <p>A distributor, supplier or a producer can drop ship. In other words, on the retailers’ online store, the client orders a product.  The order and customer details are automatically forwarded to the dropship supplier. The product is then packaged and moved to the client at the leave of the retailer.</p>
               <p>From this description, it is a simple business strategy which significantly needs retailers to work in close relation with their distributor or suppliers to maintain a continuous and smooth supply chain. </p>
               <p>This type of collaboration existing among distributors and the retailers is what makes drop shipping differ from the rest of the business strategy. You do not need to produce anything; you do not have to purchase your commodities in advance, make payment nor offer a fee to have them stacked in a store.  </p>
               <p>All you need to do is to set up an online shopping platform; one that will enhance sales and see to it that you succeed in what you have started.</p>
               
               <h5>The Benefits inherent in drop shipping</h5>
               <p>There are several benefits one derives from drop shipping. A few of the benefits are scheduled below: </p>
               
               <p><b></b>1.	It is simple to set up: Setting up a drop shipping business isn’t that difficult. It is a process of just three steps including locating a supplier, designing a commanding website, describing your product and selling. If you are new to e-commerce business, it is as simple as described. </p>
               <p><b></b>2.	Its startup cost is relatively low: Unlike other conventional businesses that have a high initial startup cost with considerable running expenditure, the drop shipping business involves a comparatively less costly initial startup capital with little operating expenditure. Products are not purchased for inventory. So the cost of inventory, store, and other overhead expenses are eliminated. Website hosting, app and site maintenance fees are the only associated fees </p>
               <p><b></b>3.	No overhead Cost: As earlier mentioned, drop shipping does not warrant stocks or inventory holding hence; you do not need to rent a warehouse or storage space neither would you pay electricity, phones, and other administrative charges. The concern is only about maintaining your website.</p>
               <p><b></b>4.	Business risk is low: Unlike other business that has everything at stake, dropshipping does not. What do I mean? In traditional businesses, where there are no sales, the owner has so much to lose. He has to cover the cost and bills incurred. This means, there is an increased pressure to make sales to allow for the continued existence of the business. There is no inventory in drop shipping, and so the risk of business failure and subsequent negative pressure is eliminated.</p>
               <p><b></b>5.	The business can be operated from any location: The commitment and considerations for office space are eliminated. One can work from any location including the beach, bedroom, inside a vehicle, etc and still make money. Your internet connectivity and laptop are the only input you need.</p>
               <p><b></b>6.	Product Varieties and options to choose: Drop shippers exist for any product you could ever think of. You have the option to sell a product, run several products or combine the products in whichever manner you deem fit. Simply identify a niche, and a supplier will definitely be handy.</p>
               <p><b></b>7.	Scaling is easy: Unlike the traditional retail business which more profit is dependent upon expansion, increase resources (time, human and funds), hence scaling is difficult; it is different in drop shipping. To increase profit, effect more orders to you drop shipper. They will take care of every other thing while you earn</p>
               <p><b></b>8.	Little or no Losses and damages to products: The products are shipped directly to the customer. Product handling that goes on in the supply chain of traditional businesses eliminated. With less physical contact with products, the likelihood of damages is reduced.</p>
               
                <h5>The Demerits of Dropshipping</h5>
                <p>As with every other business, there is always a flip side to it. The drop shipping business also comes with its demerits. Here are a few demerits to consider while to you of the dropship business model:</p>

                <p><b></b>1.	Low-profit margins: Some factors including your supplier, location, and your niche may cause your profit margin to be small. Long distances imply higher charges, different niches and suppliers also have different fees. This might impact your gross revenue at the end of the day.</p>
                <p><b></b>2.	Huge Loss when things go wrong: Irrespective the situation or fault. Whether it is from you or the supplier, you lose virtually everything where an error ensues. The client makes the order on the retailers’ site. Should the supplier make a mistake by supplying the wrong specification, the retailer is held accountable since he interfaces with the clients. So, be sure of who you hire as your supplier.</p>
                <p><b></b>3.	Low level of control: The satisfaction of the customer is tied to the details and custom packaging of the product so shipped. He pays attention to the delivery notes which arrives with the product as well. While some suppliers allow the retailers a level of control as to the manner the delivery is made, others do not. Seemingly, suppliers who are willing to do so may demand additional charges.</p>
                <p><b></b>4.	Complexities issues: while selling multiple products presents itself as a profitable venture, this may yield less result if there are several suppliers for the products. Of course, issues bothering on charges, location, the niche is imminent. The retailer will be tempted to transfer these cost on the client who may be impacted negatively.</p>
                <p><b></b>5.	Highly competitive: Owing to the popularity and attractiveness of the dropshipping business, new entrants are coming into the various niches daily. To the new retailers, these could be detrimental to their success.</p>
                <p><b></b>6.	Needs pro-activeness in inventory management: Tracking stock and inventory could be tricky. Information not adequately communicated, misrepresentation of products can cause the cancellation and rejection of orders and delivery. With modern technology, these issues can be managed but a cost to the retailer. The overhead cost might likely increase.</p>

                <h5>What to do before beginning a dropshipping business</h5>
