               <h3 class="text-center">Hashtags - An Introductory Guide to its Usage</h3>
                <p>In more recent times, promoting brands and ideas on social media platforms is becoming common. One way in which users execute this task is through the use of Hashtags. Initially, what was typical to twitter handles is now common on other platforms, including Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and Google plus. An understanding of Hashtag and its usage makes it possible to influence and engage your audience. When properly used, social media users quickly discover your ideas or post. </p>

                <h5>What is a Hashtag?</h5>
                <p>The hashtag is a word, abbreviation or phrase preceded by a hash sign (#), used on social media websites and applications, especially Twitter, to identify messages on a specific topic. Hashtags attract the attention of the audience, who may likely initiate a conversation on the shared idea.</p>

                <h5>How to Hashtag - What are the basics?</h5>
                <p><b></b>RadiumOne, a social media agency opines that about 75% of people on social media make use of hashtags. Though its usage is as simple as placing the # mark before a word or phrase with neither space nor punctuation, only a few people can effectively use it. To get the most out of your marketing strategy, there are a few precise modulations you should understand. Come on board as this article lead you through them.</p>

                <p><b></b>1.	Eliminate Spaces: A hashtag may be a single word, a phrase, an idea, an acronym, or a combo of words with numbers. Do not include spaces or punctuations in between words in the phrase forms of hashtags. It is great to have a number type hashtag but it should consist of at least a letter. Having a hashtag laid out only with numbers is wrong.</p>
                <p><b></b>2.	Begin With the # Symbol: Place the # mark at the beginning and continue with letters and or a combination of numbers. The # symbol varies according to location. For instance; while it is known as a pound or number sign in the USA or Canada, it is termed a hash sign in the UK, and Ireland.</p>
                <p><b></b>3.	Create Your Hashtag: Everyone can make a hashtag. It entails that you think it up. You can place it at the end or anywhere in the message, provided it makes sense, and it’s readable.</p>
                <p><b></b>4.	Hashtags should be Unique: Do you consider yours as a new one, then perform a search on the platform you wish to place the hashtag.  There is a 30% chance that the hashtag you think its unique have been used for some other purposes. There is isn’t a law limiting you from using some hashtag that has been used but doing so only initiates confusion. Its only demerit is that; Users may view you as trying to hijack an ongoing conversation or seeking unnecessary attention. To avoid this, find a unique hashtag.</p>
                <p><b></b>5.	Hashtags should be Easy to Understand and Remembered: Keep it brief, especially on Twitter, which provides only limited characters. You get a better result if the right word, abbreviation, or phrase is used for the hashtag. Lengthy hashtags are difficult to pronounce and are not easy to commit to memory. Users find it complicated and are unable to use. Short and simple is the key. </p>
                <p><b></b>6.	Using Hashtag Already in Existence: Instead of creating a new hashtag, should you desire to join the conversation around a topic where a hashtag exists, place the hashtag at the end or somewhere of the Twitter tweets or updates. In this way, you have shared an idea around a similar topic. You have joined the discussion. The enthusiastic audience will now see your post.</p>
                <p><b></b>7.	When not to Use a Hashtag: Avoid hashtag pollution. This implies the use of several hashtags in a message. It becomes tough to read. It is an etiquette seen as inadequate to seek attention by placing hashtags in an unrelated discussion. Create and be sure that your post is related to the hashtag you use.</p>
                
                
                <h5>How to Use Hashtag on Social Platform</h6>
                <p>Several social networks began to use hashtags after it was initially accepted on Twitter as a means of communication. Since then, their use, on other social network, has been remarkable. </p>
                
                <h6>1.	Hashtags on Twitter </h6>
                <p>The use of hashtags on Twitter can surge your involvement. Ideally, 1 – 2 hashtags per tweet should be used. When Hashtags are shared, and a request made to other users to retweet, it generates even more involvement. Twitter hashtags make you accessible to people and can be used to find a conversation to join. To have the best from Twitter, use the Twitter research tool Twitonomy. Twitonomy identifies popular hashtags and can be sequenced to customize hashtags and make the tweeting exercise simple.</p>

                <h6>2.	Hashtags on Facebook</h6>
                <p>Do you require more exposure, then try out hashtags on your Facebook post. Do not include too many hashtags on Facebook. One or two is ideal on the Facebook platform. You seem like an amateur and annoying to other users reading your post when you use too many hashtags here. Schedule your post to the public setting if you desire extensive exposure rather than limiting to friends and family. In this manner, the interested user can find and join the conversation. </p>
                
                <h6>3.	Hashtags on LinkedIn </h6>
                <p>The use of hashtags has not been emphasized on LinkedIn. However, like other platforms, hashtags operate similarly. If the content you publish is lengthy, then include a few hashtags in the body of your content. 1 – 3 hashtags is ideal. On LinkedIn, your hashtag content is placed even before users who aren’t part of your network. It is definitely one of the surest means of receiving attention.</p>

                <h6>4.	Using Hashtags on Instagram: </h6>
                <p>More hashtags result in more engagement. About ten or eleven relevant and well-known hashtags can be used on this platform to get more audience. You can go as many as 30 hashtags on Instagram. You may not need that many, but it is ideal to understand that it is acceptable if you do so. On the search handle, you can identify what hashtags are influencing users the more. Since the platform allows for multiple hashtags, then utilize an array of hashtags on a post, images, and comments</p>

                <h6>5.	Using Hashtags on Pinterest</h6>
                <p>On Pinterest, hashtags are a fantastic way of surging your content based on scheduled keywords. 1 – 2 hashtags, which are related to the topic, should be used. Going wide is detrimental. So be unique and craft hashtags that are topic limited.</p>

                <h6>6.	Using Hashtags on Google +</h6>
                <p>Hashtags are a pathway to greater involvement on this platform. It is advantageous for search engines optimization. You can include up to three hashtags when sharing ideas or content on Google +. Google automatically adds or recommends hashtags to content not having a hashtag. Utilize it when commenting on the Goole Plus. It is advisable to be consistent with a particular hashtag on this platform.</p>
                
                <p>Be specific on any hashtag so chosen at any time. You get attracted more to the targeted audience when you are specific. Your competition is also using the hashtag as a strategy. Check out their success rating at engaging your mutual audience. Be interested in the rate at which they use the hashtags and learn from them.  To be successful, understand your audience and pay more attention to the norms of every platform. Hashtags are essential for communication and attracting new clients.  Though it may take a while to identify the best hashtag strategy, a planned social media which captures hashtags is worth the effort.</p>
