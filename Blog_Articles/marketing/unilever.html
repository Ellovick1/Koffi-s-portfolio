               <h3>Unilever and Its Organizational Changes</h3>
               <h5>1.0 Introduction</h5> 
               <p>George, (2017) outlined factors critical for business success to include: management style, employee attitude, business location, cost control, product development among others. Chapman, (2009) in his study qualified these factors as necessary conditions but described organizational change as a sufficient condition for result.  Drucke, (1993) opines that organization initiates and set up capacities to manage and meet deliverables by constantly improving upon existing ideas. These ideas fly for a period and are outshined by other new concept signaling the need for another change (Howson, 2007). However, while Mossholder et al. (2000) considered change as a concept which is imperative for growth, Ven and Poole, (2005) and Kassim et al., (2010) saw  it as a description of the series of processes within which new methods spring up in a firm. </p>

               <h5>2.0 The Essence of Organizational Change</h5>
                <p>The essence of change is to revamp and ensure that the firm clientele relationship which is vital to organizational goal improves (Nelissen and Selm, 2008).  Camall, (2007) identified the reason for changes to include; the need to be more efficient and manage resources properly, operate effectively, improve upon the existing channel of communication and remove operational bottlenecks as well as increasing revenue. Harwood and Giles, (2005) opined that firms introduce new concepts, strategies, and organizational procedures with its resultant consequences to the adoptees being either positive or negative. </p>

                <h5>3.0 Organizational Change; the case of Unilever</h5>
                <p>Unilever occasionally set up change to support its operations. The firm once established a chemical unit to process the oils it uses to make margarine. At the time managers believed this route provided them with a predictable and controllable source of materials for fragrances and food flavorings. Unilever was structured around five primary business groups: food products, personal-care products, soap/laundry products, cosmetics/perfume/hair products, and specialty chemicals. </p>
                <p>The operations in the four consumer products groups were all very similar except the chemicals group because it had no consumer products and an indirect linkage between operations and those in the consumer products groups including the production of chemical that were to create their consumer products for resale. In the mid-1990s Unilever’s board of directors grew concerned about the firm’s seeming inability to gain market share from Procter & Gamble. A new CEO was hired to remedy this situation and to improve Unilever’s financial performance. He identified the specialty chemical businesses as a problem and so Unilever executives decided to sell the specialty chemical units </p>
                <p>With the proceed, Unilever acquired a leading diet products firm. However, managers soon realized that selling the chemicals business and buying new food products businesses were not addressing problems such as slow decision and weak control of worldwide marketing strategies. As a result, the company reorganized its operation into two main units rather than four. One unit would be responsible for all food products and the other for all home and personal-care products. Each unit was then assigned its own chief executive responsible for all its global operations. </p>
                <p>In 2005 Patrick Cescau a new CEO at the time, agreed that the firms’ structure was satisfactory but might benefit from some fine-tuning. So, he introduced a hybrid design for the home and personal-care products division. The division operates as a single entity with regard to procurement, operations, and manufacturing. But once products are manufactured, the division has two different units responsible for distribution, marketing, and sales. One handles all home care products and the other concentrates on personal-care products. In 2008, this design was further refined by the creation of regional support centers. </p>

                <h5>4.0 Result of change to Unilever</h5><br>
                <h5>4.1 Effect of disposing Unilever’s chemical business </h5>
                <p>The sale eliminated inefficiencies created by the firm’s structure and generated cash that could be used to reduce debt and finance new acquisitions in Unilever’s core business areas. Higher administrative costs from dissimilar units (chemical and consumer products) and low prices as a result of producing product available in the open market were eliminated. These moves allowed Unilever to focus all its attention on competing with other firms in the consumer products markets. </p>

                <h5>4.2 Effect of re organizing the business into two units</h5>
                <p>Unilever reorganized its business into two units rather than four. One unit would be responsible for all food products and the other for all home and personal-care products. Each unit was then assigned its chief executive responsible for all its global operations. This new arrangement proved to be reasonably successful.</p>

                <h5>4.3 Effect of a hybrid design</h5>
                <p>The hybrid design allowed clusters of neighboring countries to function as one entity, leveraging regional scale through shared services for functions such as human resource management, information technology, and finance.  We have achieved the right structure, said the managers’</p>

                <h5>5.0 Conclusion</h5>
                <p>From the foregoing, the frequent changes in organization design at Unilever seem to be relatively positive.</p>
