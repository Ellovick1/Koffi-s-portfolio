          <h3 class="text-center">The Low Down: Should I Lease or Buy A Car?</h3>
          <p>
            Whichever your choice may be, buying or leasing a car has a lot of
            financial implications. You shouldn’t only consider the monetary
            aspect before you append your signature in agreement to a deal. If
            you choose to either buy or lease or a car, your lifestyle and
            personal taste also has a lot to say about your choice. Do you look
            forward to knowing the pros and cons that accompanies each side of
            the buy vs. lease argument? Just sit back and read on. This article
            will guide you on the core tips you need to know and understand,
            which will guide you through the question - should I lease or buy a
            car?
          </p>
          <h5>Should You Lease or Buy a Car?</h4>
          <p>
            Your preferences, budget, and goals are the core determinants
            whether you should lease or buy your next or new car. Each option
            regarding whether to buy or lease a car has its own unique set of
            benefits, but the most important thing is having a personal
            assessment of which of these benefits suits you most.
          </p>
          <em>
            “Before dashing out in search of your next or new car, taking out
            time to decide the financial implications, what terms fit best for
            you and what you stand to gain from such terms should be the factors
            that prompt your final decision.”
          </em> 

          <h5>Advantages of Buying a Car</h4>
          <p>
            In case you finally made up your mind to own a car, here are five
            (5) core benefits of your decision:
          </p>
          <div>
            <ol>
              <li><h5>You Have No Distance Restriction:</h5></li>
              <p>
                If your lifestyle is driving a car to a longer distance as you
                wish, the best option will be to own it. Leasing a car confines
                you to a certain length of miles you can cover, and once you
                flout such limit, better be ready to pay heavily.
              </p>
              <li>
                <h5>You can Accessorize to Your Taste</h5>
              </li>
              <p>
                You possibly might love having a car well accessorized. A
                well-accessorized car is precisely one area you’ll benefit when
                you buy a car because leasing one compels you to maintain the
                car in the same condition as it was handed to you irrespective
                of how long you intend to keep it.
              </p>
              <li>
                <h5>You’ll Pay Less on the Long-run</h5>
              </li>
              <p>
                Generally, monthly lease payments are cheaper compared to
                monthly car loan payments. Nevertheless, one can accrue equity
                for each loan payment which will pay off in the future once you
                decide to trade or sell it. So, with all these calculations to
                keep track of, it is best to buy a car and drive it for many
                years as you may wish. Buying merely is the cheapest way to own
                a car. However, don’t forget that the longer you drive your car,
                the lesser it will cost when you want to sell it off.
              </p>
              <li>
                <h5>You are at Liberty to Sell It</h5>
              </li>
              <p>
                Compared to a car lease where you are stuck in a fixed ownership
                time-frame, once you own a car, you can choose to sell it at any
                time. With this flexibility of possessing and selling your car,
                you can quickly pay off any record of your loan balance.
              </p>
              <li>
                <h5>You can Discount the Level of Depreciation</h5>
              </li>
              <p>
                Within the first few years of using a car, about 25-40%
                depreciation in its worth is bound to take place. So, what this
                implies is that, when you buy a car that is about 2-3 years old,
                you have the benefit of paying an amount that is a reflection of
                its current level of depreciation.
              </p>
            </ol>

            <h5>Advantages of Leasing a Car</h4>
            <p>
              Sure you want to tread this path? If yes, it is fine. Below are
              six (6) essential benefits of leasing a car.
            </p>
            <div>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <h5>You’ll Have Fewer Repair Payment (Conditional)</h5>
                </li>
                <p>
                  During your car leasing process, one term that must be spelled
                  out is whether the car you are leasing is under a manufacturer
                  warranty. If this is inclusive, be sure not to be handed a
                  massive bill for repairs you possibly might not expect.
                  Nevertheless, you are still accountable for paying the minimum
                  amount for car insurance which is stipulated by the state
                  where you reside. Also, other regular maintenance and fixes
                  are always on you.
                </p>
                <li>
                  <h5>You’ll never be “Upside-down.”</h5>
                </li>
                <p>
                  The duration for a fixed term of a car lease is between 1-4
                  years. During this period, your expected monthly payment is a
                  function of the level of depreciation that is likely for the
                  car within the period of your lease term (different model and
                  brand of cars have different rates of depreciation). In this
                  case, you are expected to pay only for any depreciation that
                  must have occurred during the lease period, and you can never
                  go ‘upside-down’ which is a typical situation in which most
                  car owners face - owing more than their car’s worth.
                </p>
                <li>
                  <h5>No Loan Approval Required.</h5>
                </li>
                <p>
                  For you to gain approval for a car loan, you have to maintain
                  a stellar credit record; else you’ll have to pay higher
                  interest – that’s a typical requirement by lenders. Car
                  leasing companies don’t operate on such strict terms since
                  they can easily take back their car when you fail in meeting
                  their lease terms or making payments.
                </p>
                <li>
                  <h5>Lower monthly Charges</h5>
                </li>
                <p>
                  The cost of buying a car can never match comparison to leasing
                  one. Most times, leasing a car doesn’t require you to pay for
                  any upfront sales tax, and you have just a little or no down
                  payment to make. Be that as it may, when returning a leased
                  car, you may be presented with extra charges that may result
                  from having unrepaired damages, exceeding the permitted
                  mileage limit or even cutting short a lease term earlier than
                  agreed.
                </p>

                <li>
                  <h5>Access to the Newest Car Models</h5>
                </li>
                <p>
                  Yes! When you lease a new car probably on a yearly basis, you
                  will be sure to have access to driving cars with more safety
                  features, comfort, and the latest technological input. You
                  don’t necessarily have to afford to buy one before you can
                  ride in it.
                </p>
                <li><h5>6Never having to sell a vehicle.</h5></li>
                <p>
                  At the expiration of a lease term (usually a closed-end), you
                  can decide to process a new lease term for another car or
                  better return the leased car. Better still, you may be
                  presented with the option of buying the car at the expiration
                  of a lease term for a price that has already been fixed.
                  Remember, you stand to gain more where the car still worth
                  more than the pre-set purchase price but the reverse will be
                  the case when the vehicle is lesser in worth compared to the
                  price. Such experiences are not the case when you are tired of
                  using your car, because you have to get prospective buyers by
                  yourself from whom you will have a fair-trade in the worth of
                  your car.
