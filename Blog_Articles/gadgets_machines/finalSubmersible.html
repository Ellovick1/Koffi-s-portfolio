                <h3 class="text-center">A Complete Guide to Submersible Pumps</h3>
                <p>As one of the most versatile pump type, capable of running underwater,
                    the submersible pump has a wide application including raising water from the tank bottom or floor,
                    functioning as irrigation submersible pumps, sand submersible pumps,
                    sewage submersible pumps, water submersible pumps among others.
                </p>
                <p>However, owing to its broad applicability, it is essential that satisfactory performance of the pump
                    be achieved,
                    installations are done appropriately, the pump-sets are adequately selected, and proper maintenance
                    activities performed periodically. For this reason,
                    <b>Total Water</b> has put together this guide to address most of your concerns and guide your
                    decisions during your pump selection exercise.
                    Having described the submersible pumps, let us consider the definition is and how it works.
                </p>

                <h5>Definition of the Submersible Pumps</h5>
                <p>The submersible pump sometimes called the sump pump is a kind of centrifugal pump designed to allow
                    water uptake.
                    It operates as a unit integrating a motor and a pump to an enclosed component totally immersed in
                    the fluid to be raised.
                    The pumps are finished in an impervious way; not permitting even water droplets through; hence
                    avoiding motor short out.
                </p>
                <p>Consequent on the fact that the submersible pumps do not function above the ground,
                    the floor spaces are judiciously used while the general cost of installation might significantly
                    reduce.
                    More so, a submersible pump is characterized by a noiseless operation during pumping activities, and
                    have a
                    low maintenance cost. Owing to the fact that the pump is submersible below the surface in the fluid
                    to be raised,
                    the submersible pump has the advantage of being self-priming.
                </p>
                <h5>How does a Submersible Pump Work?</h5>
                <p>Mechanically, the submersible pump arrives with a combination of the chamber with an impeller termed
                    the stage; in addition to the stage is the lift.
                    An explicit connection of the impellers to the motors creates a flow with the flow rate being a
                    function of the head.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As already described, a submersible pump is sealed to ensure that the interior fittings are secured
                    from water.
                    The pumps operate with the aid of a floats switch. The float switch can detect water level. Upon the
                    detection of water,
                    the motor embedded in the pump is activated to pull water up into the pump before being forced off
                    by the impellers.
                </p>
                <p>The installation details determine the kind of motor and pump a submersible pump will arrive with.
                    Basically, two types exist. One functions in wet wells and the other in dry wells.
                    A skinny submersible motor at the base of the pump functions in bored well. The motor is finished
                    with a suction belt just above it to channel
                    fluid into the centrifugal pump stage comprising the impellers which may be multi-staged for the
                    pumping mechanism.
                </p>
                <p>The flow rate from both types ranges from less than 10 gallons per minute for a residential purpose,
                    to many thousand gallons per minute for industrial, irrigation, or municipal usage.
                </p>

                <h5>What are the uses of the Submersible Pump?</h5>
                <p>Submersible pumps have a wide array of application. Its numerous usages make it seem like a complex
                    machine.
                    The submersible pump can be used for one of the following as schedule below:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Irrigation:</b> The submersible pump is used to apply controlled amounts of water to plants
                        at needed intervals.
                        Ranging from effective garden watering to removing water from aquariums, ponds and the water
                        holdings, the submersible pumps are a vital component of an irrigated piece of land. Often, they
                        are integrated into rainwater to channel the flow into farmland.
                        A set up of this nature reduces the dependency on main water; hence; becomes a source of savings
                        in the long run.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Used to raise water from boreholes and wells:</b> The submersible pump is perfect for raising
                        water from boreholes and
                        wells. These wells or bores may span several depths beneath. The make of the pump enhances its
                        performance in tight
                        partitions and raise or pump water with minimal pressure.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Draining Unwanted Bodies Water:</b> The pump is also ideal when unwanted water or liquid is
                        needed out of a location.
                        The submersible pump empties flood water from basements or areas with regular flooding. Minimal
                        or no human effort is required.
                        The auto-electric finishing of the pump causes it to channel off water without your physical
                        presence easily.

                <h5>Selecting an Appropriate Submersible Pump</h5>
                <p>
                    The pumps need to be installed to specifications, and so many consider replacement of submersible pump
                     as a daunting task or process. This should not be the case. 
                    A few hints to think and abide as you select your submersible pump.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Check the Old Pump:</b> Are you considering replacing a broken pump? First, 
                        you have to consider the previous installations. Go through the previous labels. 
                        The label has the specification and the details to which it was designed to meet. 
                        This specification will include the size or diameter of the discharging pipes. 
                        It is an ideal place to begin because it is easy to identify the pump type you will be requesting. 
                        Confirm that the pump type and size you are asking whether; online or from the physical stores.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Select the Right Float Switch:</b> It is very common to see people make the mistake of purchasing the
                         wrong type of float switch. Two examples are available in the market: the tethered switch pump and the
                          vertical switch pump. The former operates the pump by transiting a diagonal direction upwards. 
                          They can be found in pumps with about 14-inch intake and a submersible in heavy duty. The latter being 
                          the vertical switch pump has its switch installed to operate the pump by transiting straight up. 
                        The floats are used in submersible pumps with a smaller diameter about 10-inch
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>The Battery Backup System:</b> One reason for using the submersible pump is to shield the home from flooding. If you desire that the pump be kept on during the flood, bear in mind that power may be interrupted at any given time. For this reason, it is advisable to get a pump that comes with a backup battery mechanism to have a continuous supply of power. 
                        With this setup, you can rest assured that though power is used for the pumping operation, you will still have some intact whenever there is a flood. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Think of the Pumping Distance:</b>  The submersible pumps arrive in various sizes and shapes.
                         A unique feature is the power capacity of the pumps. Think of the distance of the intended liquid to be pumped. The range is a function of the pump capacity. 
                        Far distance requires higher pump capacity and vis-à-vis the short ones.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       <b> Determine the fluid Viscosity:</b> It is also essential to evaluate the viscosity of the liquid you intend to pump. 
                        The ease of pumping is directly related to the fluid viscosity. Thicker fluids are more difficult to pump than those 
                        having low viscosity property. For instance; clean water is comparatively easy to be pumped since it has low viscosity.
                         However, if the fluid is muddy or dirty, a pump having more power is ideal because it is highly viscous.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h5>Dos & Don’ts of Purchasing a Submersible Pump</h5>
                <p>
                    Before acquiring a pump, there are certain things you should look out for. Some are to assist your pump last
                     long while others are to allow continuous usage. 
                    Also, you will need to go through the pump manuals properly for ease of installation and operations.
                </p>

                <h5>The DO’S of the Submersible Pump</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Examine and verify that the pump isn't damaged before purchasing or renting it for use.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Be sure that the cables are not frayed and are all intact
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make connections to an appropriate power source which should be stationed several distance from the flood water
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Keep a note of the pump type and model before its installation in the sump in case it fails while underwater, 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It is imperative that the float switch moves without restrictions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Submersible pump break down when the pump runs dry often triggered by a problematic float switch, 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Check to see that the pump filters is adequately cleaned. As a practice, give the pump filter a properly clean; 
                        monthly interval may be ideal. It will maintain your pump in an excellent working condition.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <h5>The DONT’S of the Submersible Pump</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Do not lower the power cables below with the Pump
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The pump will break if the power cable frays while the pump is lowered. Be careful while lowering the pump into place
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There should be no contact between electricity and water. Electricity and water do not mix. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Do not admit water into the setup. It freezes around the pump. Frozen water expands. This could destroy the innermost operation of the pump.

                        By their design, the submersible is to pump water routinely. So, do not allow the pump to run dry. Acquire a submersible that comes with a float switch to automatically cut off power.

                        Hermetically seal the pump by covering or closing the submersible pump.

                        <b>It is up to two years, and the bowls are all worn out. How do I attend to this? </b>
                        Should this be the case, remove the pump. Seek the services of a professional who has a good service rig. 
                        Do not embark upon this task on your own. With the appropriate equipment, the professional will pull out the 
                        submersible pump without destroying the pipes, pumps or the power cables.

                        <b>My pump isn’t functioning, what could be responsible for this? </b>
                        Several reasons could be responsible. Most typically could be burnout. 
                        In case water does not move about the motor casing into the intake, the motor 
                        isn’t experiencing adequate cooling. This can cause overheating. Install your pump 
                        a little above the screen but beneath the dynamic pumping, height to allow water flow down. 
                        Shrouding could be ideal
