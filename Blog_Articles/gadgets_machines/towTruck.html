            <h3 class="text-center">Various Types of Tow Trucks	</h3>
            <p>
                Our auto cars malfunctions when you least anticipate. Irrespective the location; the highway, the parking space, or the garage, your next line of action will be to seek the services of a towing company to convey your vehicle to the auto mechanic for repairs. Tow trucks otherwise called the wrecker, recovery vehicle or the breakdown lorry are used for such purposes. In summary, tow trucks are vehicles used to convey or evacuate confiscated, broken down, debilitate, damaged, or poorly parked cars. The tow truck arrives in various models and brands with varying degree of popularity. This article is intended to elucidate information on the different types of tow trucks, and their specific use to enable you to understand which best suits your needs.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Flatbed Tow Truck:</b> The flatbed tow is typical and widely used tow. Owing to its manner of operations, it has been referred to as a slide truck. Its most dominant characteristics include the possession of a large or extended hydraulic flatbed disposed of an up and down moving mechanism. It slides downwards to the ground to allow the vehicle to be secured over it. For immobile cars, the flatbed trucks possess a hoist; lifting device consisting of a rope or chain winding around a horizontal rotating drum, turned typically by a crank or by a motor that draws it unto the bed. They are easy to use and can convey an array of vehicles, and boats. On the ranks, it is considered the safest tow truck.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Hook and Chain Tow Truck:</b> Probably the oldest, the hook and chain tow truck are commonly used to move scrap or wrecked automobiles to metal scrap yards. To achieve this purpose, a chain is strapped at the front bumper of the vehicle and drawn with the aid of boom winch fixed to the truck.  Should you invite a tow, and all you get is a hook and chain, you will be identifying damages to your car at the end of the service. The chain braises the car surface, while in some vehicles, the bumper or the drivetrain may be destroyed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Integrated Tow Trucks:</b> This tow truck type operates via differing mechanisms and functions as a unit in a combination of a boom and wheel lift. The integrated tow trucks are considerably specialized and sophisticated. It is fashioned to serve the mid-size vehicles and suit heavy duties as well. The truck possesses an additional axle which gives stability and rigidity to the truck. Other rigs or buses can be moved with it
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Wheel-Lift Tow Truck:</b> The Wheel-lift tow trucks could be likened to the hook and chain tow trucks, but their mode of operation varies. Rather than have a hook and a chain, the wheel-lift and tow clamps a metal yoke only to the wheels. From underneath the car drive wheel, the yoke is fastened to the rear or front and hoist to raise it with the hydraulic lift. Like the flatbed truck, the wheel-lift offers a considerable level of safety but not same, and are less expensive.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Boom Trucks:</b> Considered as the simplest way of recovering vehicles, this truck type possesses a hydraulic arm, known as a boom which extends over the length of the car. Some booms are flexible while others are fixed to a position. Consider the boom as a mini crane prototype. Initially, the boom trucks utilize the hook and chain system to raise vehicles. Nowadays, they come with a belt or sling lift which offers a level of safety. With the hoist and strapping mechanism, vehicles are towed.  Since there is a likelihood of damaging the drivetrain, it should be used on selected cars.
