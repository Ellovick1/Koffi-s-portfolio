                <h5>6. Volvo XC60</h5>
                <p><img style="margin:10px; float: right; width: 20%; height: 30%;" src="/img/volvo X6.png">
                    Although the company has sold over 1 million units since its introduction nine years ago, the latest cross Volvo is the XC60. This midsize SUV comes in various options such as; sport-focused R-drive also known as deluxe inscription and the momentum trim. Also, available for your choice are three powertrains such as; the supercharged T6 and turbocharged T5 engine. But, the best to go for is the plug-in T8 electric hybrid. </p>
                <p> At lower rpm, this special T8 engine uses a supercharger while it uses a turbocharger at higher revolutions. These help to push in more air into the combustion chamber to create more power. The hybrid version doesn’t lose a lot of interior space due to its battery being fixed in the center tunnel. Charging it can be done using standard household outlet of 220-110v or general charging station with an outlet of 200v and it takes about 2.5 hours to reach a full charge. Preferably, you can decide to use the gas engine to charge the battery but this isn’t really efficient.</p>
                <p><b>•	Self-Driving Features Added-</b> For 2018, the XC60 is graced with steer assist. This helps the driver when trying a manoeuver to avoid hitting an object in front by enhancing the effectiveness of the turn through the braking of inner wheels and additional steering input. All these are returned after the maneuver to settle the chassis. Also, with the Oncoming Lane Mitigation, the XC60 can easily steer itself into the right lane if it senses with the forward facing camera that it is in the path of an oncoming car </p>
                <p><b></b>•	Apart from being a safety conscious coupe, the interior tech of the XC60 is excellent. The XC60 has an updated UI on its 9 inches Sensus Connect touchscreen with bigger fonts and color-coded tiles. The screen is super-intuitive, easy to use and can work with gloves but slow boot time of about 15 seconds is its flaws. You can also, have both the Android Auto and Apple Carplay standard without each using up the entire screen so that you can easily access the main navigation, Bluetooth, media all at the same time. Also available are WiFi and 4G LTE connectivity but the major point of disappointment is that the XC60 has only two USB ports which are placed in the central armrest </p>
                <p><b>•	Pricing-</b> Considering the T8 engine, driver assist, vision package for blind spot and parking monitoring and four-corner air suspension which can all add up to a whopping $16,000, Volvo gives out the Inscription model with the T8 engine for $56,700 including an incentive of $5,002 for federal tax. For the momentum trim with T5 engine, Volvo gives this off at $41,500 while the momentum trim with a T6 engine goes for $44,900. Whichever your choice may be, the XC60 T8 is full of various breath-taking features and standard safety gadgets and its excellent hybrid engine. All these make the XC60 midsize crossover a luxury, safe and fun to drive midsize SUV</p>
                    
                <h5>7.  Hyundai Santa Fe</h5>

                    Additional cabin tech is a new ultrasonic Rear Seat Occupant Alert System which is sensor-based.

                <p><b>•	Pricing-</b> To avoid misguided information, we have to wait until the fuel economy figures of the Santa Fe are released so that we can tell of how much value it will be to customers. However, from the look of it high-tech design, its evident that the 2019 Santa Fe won't get anything less than a fair portion of attention from lots of buyers. Also, coupled with the long list of various safety features, the redefined cabin look and other powertrain diversity which are shocking, it is self-evident that the 2019 Santa Fe won't drift from its position as the best-selling SUV from Hyundai</p>

Durango’s 475HP stems from its eight-speed auto transmission and all-round the clock AWD system.  Other tech features on the Durango which gives it a high safety-conscious reputation include a a blindspot monitoring device, auto emergency braking, rear-cross traffic alerts, lane-maintaining assist, and adaptive cruise. </p>

                    Never have I applauded some of the recent safety features such as the forward collision warning in cars until Toyota Highlander helped me to see what it means to have one of such elements in a vehicle.
                    <p><b>Safety Feature- </b>The Toyota Highlander is a perfect bridge that links the gap between the Toyota 4Runner and the two-row Toyota RAv4 crossover. It has a prominent space for about seven to eight passengers in the Toyota Highlander. However, the last row is designed for kids that can balance on a car seat. The new Toyota Highlander 2017 model now got a new design which features LED rear lights. Moreover, for the SE trim, some unobvious sporty elements such as 19 inches black colored wheels, front rails, and dark front grill.</p>
                </p>
                <p>Counting from 2013 when it was first introduced, Hyundai is continuously updating the Santa Fe with various driver-assist features such as the auto emergency braking together with pedestrian detection; intelligent cruise control dynamic HID lighting, lane-deviance warning, and many other features. Safety features? These are not left out in the Santa Fe. Among such are the automatic braking system, rear-cross-traffic notification system, and the safe exit assists feature which prevents the opening of doors in front of an oncoming vehicle, and this is available both in the four-wheel and two-wheel variety.</p>
                <p>While many customers have opted for the lane-keeping assist to prevent their cars from drifting off its lane and the dynamic radar cruise control which is responsible for maintaining a particular distance away from a lead vehicle, Toyota has made the Safety Sense P (TSS-P) package to cut across all the trim levels of Highlander. All these features are cool and of great credit to Toyota except for the dynamic radar cruise control which doesn’t function at speed below 30mph and this defeat its function in stop-and-go traffic points. </p>
                <p>Although the Android Auto and Apple Carplay are not featured in the Toyota Highlander, it has its own Entune Infotainment system which correctly serves the media function. To have access to real-time weather and traffic together with a whole lot of apps such as Slacker, Yelp and Pandora, you can just install the app – Entune on your iOS or Android. </p>
                <p>Compared to other cars that tend to be slower as a result of thinner air at an altitude a bit above 5000 feet, Highlander is full of acceleration even at this altitude due to its new 3.5-liter V6 engine. Also, 263 pounds-feet of torque forces and 295HP provides Highlander enough power to go up some curvy mountainous roads without any concern. Highlander enjoys a total combined rating of exactly 23.0 due its EPA fuel rating of 27 miles/gallon on the highways, 21 miles/gallon in the city and an average of 23 miles/gallon combined. For the base Highlander, it has a standard 2.7-liter engine with 185HP with a fuel economy rating of 24miles/gallon on the highway, 20miles/gallon in the city. This is worse compared to the larger 3.7-liter engines.</p>
                <p>The Highlander hybrid can be a better choice with a 3.5 liter V6 paired alongside two electric motors for an average power output of about 306HP. This combination rewards the hybrid with an EPA fuel rating of about 29miles/gallon in the city, and this is about nine times higher than V6 in front wheel drive but still retains similar 27miles/gallon on a highway.</p>
                <p><b>•	Pricing-</b>For a start, the Highlander goes for $30,630, but the SE trim goes up to about $40,685, delivery included. The likes of Hyundai, Atlas from Volkswagen, Kia, and Chevrolet are prominent competitors in this segment. Due to its fuel efficiency and performance, the Highlander 2017 still stay up in its game though not with many flashy features. Possibly, the availability of the Toyota Safety Sense </p>
