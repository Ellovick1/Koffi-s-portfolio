            <ul>
              <li><img style="float: right; width: 20%; height: 30%;" src="/img/yellow small car.jpg" alt="" />
                Introduced in 2013, Subaru BRZ experienced its most significant
                update last year. Though still with its two-door design, the
                Subaru BRZ even accommodates four back sitter who can seat very
                comfortably especially if they are kids. The upgrading tweaks
                were necessary to enable the coupe to fit perfectly with its
                performance package. A few of such package includes a wider
                Brembo® brakes which are designed to aid a faster-stopping power
                so that you can confidently hit the twisties.
              </li>
              <li>
                There are about three trim levels to pick from with the 2017
                Subaru BRZ. These include Series, Premium and Limited. With any
                trim level you choose, the rear-wheel-drive Subaru BRZ is
                embedded with a six-speed manual transmission and a 2.0L
                four-cylinder engine. Do you need plenty of responsive handling
                and power? This engine and speed combination is sure to do just
                that.
              </li>
              <li>
                With a stickshift version of a stop, expect a 2016 Subaru BRZ
                to go as far as 60mph. However, the 2017 Subaru BRZ which is
                equipped with the fast six-speed manual transmission and a 2.0L
                four-cylinder engine, can go an approximate of 21mpg in the town
                and 29mpg on a highway (1).
              </li>
            </ul>

          <h5>8. Mazda MX-5 Miata</h5>            
            <ul>
              <li><img style="float: right; width: 20%; height: 30%;" src="/img/redcar.jpg" alt="" />
                The “Retractable Fastback” design of MX-5 Miata was the new
                design to bless 2017. The retractable roof of the Mazda MX-5
                Miata is pretty swift that it can retract before a stoplight
                changes from yellow to green. Adding to this is the low-slung
                physique and nice powerful lines. In case you don’t want the
                entire roof to stow away completely, just the overhead roof
                panel and the rear window can be hidden. The coupe is a cool
                ride for a two-seater.
              </li>
              <li>
                The 2017 Mazda MX-5 Maita has three trim levels which are all
                powered by an average 2.0L four-cylinder engine capable of
                delivering about 155HP. The sports trim level of this car has a
                black cloth-trimmed sports seat while the club design has, also,
                a red accent edging. The Grand Touring trim level will blow your
                mind with its supple leather seats which you can comfortably in

            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li><img style="float: right; width: 20%; height: 30%;" src="/img/small blue car.jpg" alt="" />
                The elemental compositions of the best sports car such as
                rear-wheel drive, two passengers with two doors are all the
                features the Subaru WRX carries all alone. Being able to
                accommodate five passengers, the 2017 Subaru WRX Premium is
                wrought by a turbocharged engine with four-cylinders. The nimble
                handling and six-speed stick shift are the bombs about the
                Subaru WRX.

                are retained in the WRX in 2017. In case of wheel spinning,
                while turning on slippery terrain, the all-wheel drive of the

                enable you to reduce power loss.

          <ul>
            <li><img style="float: right; width: 20%; height: 30%;" src="/img/nevyblue car.jpg" alt="" />

              <li><img style="float: right; width: 20%; height: 30%;" src="/img/deepgreen.jpg" alt="" />
