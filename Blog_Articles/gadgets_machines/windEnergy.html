          <h3>A Wind Energy Pioneer: Charles F. Brush</h3>
          <p>
            Charles F. Brush (1849-1929), one of the founders of the American
            electrical industry is known For his inventions including the
            efficient DC dynamo used in the public electrical grid, the first
            commercial electrical arc light, and an efficient method for
            manufacturing lead-acid batteries. His company, Brush Electric in
            Cleveland, Ohio, was sold in 1889 and in 1892 it was merged with
            Edison General Electric Company under the name General Electric
            Company (GE).
          </p>
          <h5>The Giant Brush Windmill in Cleveland, Ohio</h5>
          <p>
            During the winter of 1887-88 Brush built what is today believed to
            be the first automatically operating wind turbine for electricity
            generation. It was a giant and massive. The World's largest - with a
            rotor diameter of 17 m (50 ft.) and 144 rotor blades made of cedar
            wood which was in operation for 20 years and charged the batteries
            in the cellar of his mansion. Despite the size of the turbine, the
            generator was only a 12 kW model. This is due to the fact that
            slowly rotating wind turbines of the American wind rose type do not
            have a particularly high average efficiency. However, Dane Poul la
            Cour later discovered that fast rotating wind turbines with few
            rotor blades are more efficient for electricity production than slow
            moving wind turbines.
          </p>
          <h5>The Scientific American Article about the Brush Windmill</h5>
          <p>
            20 December 1890 the journal Scientific American has a very detailed
            description of the Brush windmill. It is particularly noted for its
            fully automated electrical control system. Its principles using
            solenoids does not change very much with future generations of wind
            turbines - until about 1980 when the wind turbine controllers become
            equipped with computers. It is difficult to estimate the effect of
            an invention on existing practices and industries. Occasionally a
            new invention will appear which will greatly affect a whole range of
            allied inventions and industries in such a way as to entirely change
            time-honored customs, inaugurate new practices and establish new
            arts. The commercial development of electricity is a notable example
            of this. After Mr. Brush successfully accomplished practical
            electric illumination by means of arc lights, incandescent lighting
            was quickly brought forward and rapidly perfected. Gas lighting was
            also improved in various ways. Simultaneously with these, the
            electric distribution of power was carried forward, and important
            improvements were made in prime movers for driving dynamos. In this
            direction much has been done both in steam and water motors. Wind
            power has been repeatedly suggested for driving dynamos, but the
            adaptation of the windmill to this use seems to have been a problem
            fraught with difficulties. Few have dared to grapple with it, for
            the question not only involved the motive power itself and the
            dynamo, but also the means of transmitting the power of the wheel to
            the dynamo, and apparatus for regulating, storing and utilizing the
            current. By this, it does not mean that electric lighting by means
            of power supplied in this way is cheap because the wind costs
            nothing. On the contrary, the cost of the plant is so great as to
            more than offset the cheapness of the motive power. However, there
            is a great satisfaction in making use of one of nature's most unruly
            motive agents. It is found after continued use of this electric
            plant that the amount of attention required to keep it in working
            condition is practically nothing. It has been in constant operation
            for more than twenty years, and has proved in every respect a
            complete success.
