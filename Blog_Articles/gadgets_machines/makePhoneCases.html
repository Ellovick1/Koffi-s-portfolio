                <p>Mainly, cases are accessories fashioned to give support and safeguard phones from damages
                    accruing to dust and drop. Not only are phone cases reasonably expensive, but they also arrive
                    the marketplace in numerous sizes, brands and make. Apparently, for these reasons, many users
                    find it difficult to identify one that fits their phone and personality. However, making a phone
                    case can be more comfortable and easy than it seems. If so, then It’s time to make one for yourself
                    right away
                </p>

                <h5>1. How to make a hot glue mobile phone case</h5>

                <p>a) <b>Pattern the shape of your phone -</b> Designing a smooth case may be daunting using hot glue.
                    Often, many people choose the spiraling pattern. Trace or freehand the pattern. If you decide to
                    trace, then the procedure is as scheduled- Mark the edges of your phone onto a piece of paper. Using
                    black ink, sketch and crop the pattern of your phone along the marked delineation and mask the
                    pattern to the rear of the phone</p>


                <p>b) <b>Swaddle your phone with stiff translucent paper -</b> Sever the size of the paper twice your
                    phone. Position your phone on top. The screen should point down. Swaddle the severed paper around
                    the verges and sides of your phone and support both with a tape. The top and base of the phone
                    should be supported as well with the tape. Wrap your phone firmly as possible. Switch it off to
                    avoid overheating and be sure to tape everything up to the phone screen.</p>


                <p> c) <b>Crop the Parts -</b> With a pen, blotch the parts of your phone including the camera, socket,
                    mic cavity, speaker, and buttons. Blotching guides you in tracing these parts so that you do not
                    mistakenly envelope them with the hot glue. The colours used for the blotching must be visible.
                    Properly layout, and fill the verges with the glue and be sure to make it neat</p>


                <p> d) <b>Detach the case and the paper -</b> As soon as the glue is fastened, flay it off your phone.
                    Detach the paper and try out your case on your phone. Make the final checks for glues covering the
                    buttons and other parts of the phone. Crop them off with a craft blade if there is any.</p>

                <p>e) <b>Colour or paint your case if you wish -</b> Once satisfied, remove your phone and paint the
                    exterior with nail polish. Allow to dry. As an alternative, use spray paint if you desire a solid
                    colour for your case. </p>

                <h5>2. How to make a Silicone Phone Case</h5>
                    
                       <p> a) <b>Wear plastic gloves and shield your work surface - </b> Your work table or surface should
                        be adequately covered with plastic, wax coverings or with any other material. A marble or glass
                        surface can still pass for a work surface. The working area must be well ventilated since
                        silicon could be so pungent. The silicone which is used here is not similar to the glue.</p>
                   
    
                        <p>b) <b>Determine your cornstarch and Silicone quantity -</b> Turn some cornstarch on to a surface
                            or glass container and gush the clear silicone into it as well. Though Precision with the
                            measurement isn’t key, be sure that there is more of cornstarch than silicone in the mix. Five
                            tablespoon (50 grams) of cornstarch and about three tablespoons (40 grams) of silicone is ideal.
                            The silicone used must be clear. Silicone arrives in syringes, and it is sold in home
                            improvements outlets. Cornflour and potato starches are alternatives for cornstarch if it is not
                            readily available.
                        </p>
         
                        <p>
                            c) <b>Think of using color -</b> Though it is not compulsory you add color, it gives your phone
                        an interesting finishing. Your phone will assume a white appearance if colour is not added. Make
                        do with a few drops of dye. Fluid colour, food, and acrylic painting are also ideal.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            d) <b>Jumble the mixture into the dough -</b> Knead the mixture for about 20 rounds All the
                            cornstarch may not be picked up. The dough may assume a dirty or an unpleasing appearance. Keep
                            the kneading on
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            e) <b>Rotate the dough into a flat plate, slate or panel -</b> With a rolling pin, glass or
                        spray paint can, rotate or roll over till a sheet bigger than your phone is produced. The sheet
                        thickness should be about 1/2inch approximately 0.32 cm
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            f) <b>Position your phone on the sheet -</b> Be sure that the screen points upwards, and the
                            dough uniformly stocked to either side of the phone
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            g) <b>Swaddle the mixture over the phone sides -</b> With a paint spatula, move the dough evenly
                        around the phone. Level an even out grooves to give it a neat finishing
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            h) <b>Use stamps to impress designs -</b> Overturn your phone and cover lightly with cornstarch.
                            Use stamps to impress designs. Uplift the stamps, and you have completed. If you desire a
                            quilted design, allow the silicone to solidify for over 10 to 20 minutes, spray lightly with
                            cornstarch and with a knife, pattern cross-crossing diagonal lines in a diamond style,
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            i) <b>Allow the silicone to dry before removal -</b> The drying duration is conditional on the
                            kind of silicone used and weather. It varies between two hours to 24 hours. When dried, wrench
                            your phone out. Clean the inside with wet clothing if it is dirty.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            j) <b>Crop excess silicone -</b> About 7 millimeters away from the sides, remove excess silicone
                            and a centimeter apart between the top and bottom edges. As an option, crop along the impression
                            by the lines between the screen and case of the phone. With the aid of a craft blade, crop
                            impressions on camera, buttons, and sockets.
                        </p>
                    
                        <p>
                            k) <b>Color the stamped region with nail polish -</b> Use a color that matches your case.
                            Metallic or silver colour may be ideal. Now, produce more shapes and styles and pattern of
                            silicone individually. Dry, paint and glue them to the case using the silicone drops.
                        </p>

                <h5>3. How to make a Felt Phone Case</h5>
                        <p>
                            a) <b>Chop a piece felt into two -</b> In case you desire the case to be bulky, then use two
                        felt with either similar colors or varied colors
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            b) <b>Slit the portions a centimeter bigger than your phone -</b> Position your cellphone on the
                        felt. Using a centimeter border, outline and crop the felt. Used the cut felt to pattern other
                        pieces.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            c) <b>Position your phone between the two portions of felt -</b> Be sure that all the edges are
                        in sync. If you desire a lined case with two colors, then use one color inside and the other
                        outside.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            d) <b>Tack the surplus felt around the phone -</b> Ideally, only the two sides should be tack.
                        Allow the top edge to be open and tack the felt firmly around the phone. Though it will be close
                        fitting initially, it will slack at the end.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            e) <b>Pull out your phone and sew along the tack edges -</b> The tacks serves as a guide while
                            the sewing continues. The seam allowances which will vary depending on the phone thickness can
                            be sown with a sewing machine (back stitch at the end of your sewing) or manually (do embroidery
                            with varied colour)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            f) <b>Crop the stitched allowances -</b> Crop the stitches to about 0.3 centimeters. For a
                            distinctive appearance, use the pinking shears.
