                    HOW TO KEEP YOUR SELF SAFE DURING EXERCISE
                </h4>

                <p>
                    Routine and consistent activity is essential for vitality and good health, whether emotional,
                    social
                    or physical. Every exercise program comes with its attending risk implications. The advantage
                    derived from staying fit is enormous, thus overrides the risk implication of doing so — every
                    individual whether a beginner or an expert enters the program with anxiety and concerns over the
                    possibility of sustaining an injury at the end. It is crucial that we stay unharmed, far away
                    from
                    damages which may likely cause us to jettison the program and miss the goal. For this reason,
                    Foota.co has put together safety tips you can observe during exercise programs.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b><i>See a Doctor and other trained personnel before the program</i></b> - Visit your doctor to
                        confirm your
                        health status before undertaking an exercise program. When on the program, meet and seek the
                        advice of the coach for a progress plan. They will furnish you with safety tips to commence and
                        subsequently achieve your objective.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b><i>Exercise Safety and your Kit</i></b> - Enter the program with appropriate equipment. Hit a
                        specialty
                        outlet for expert guidance on what to wear based on your gait, weight, and shape to prevent
                        injuries. Many trainees sustain injuries as a result of their attire. Change your sports shoes
                        if they wear or tear. To get the comfy feeling, your kit must be loose-fitting apparel. One that
                        enhances movement, not heavy and adequately dissipate heat. Get your kits according to
                        specification from Foota.co, your one-stop specialty store. When you are properly kited, your
                        session becomes exciting.

                        <b><i>Warm up and Exercise safety</i></b> - It is not ideal to commence the day’s session
                        without a light
                        warm up. When the body is warmed, the body temperature increases, the blood freely circulates to
                        the muscles, your breathing steadily increases, loosen up the ligaments, tendons and ready your
                        body mentally for the activity proper. Take out 5 -10 minutes for this.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Exercise safety and diet- Your diet is as essential as your workout program. For instance, aside
                        from providing the needed energy, carbohydrates restock depleted glycogen reserves for recovery
                        and next session while proteins work to build broken down muscles. A sports nutritionist is
                        often handy to guide you on what to eat, how much to eat and when to eat to be at your prime.

                    <li>
                        Exercise safety and Hydration- About half a liter of water or fluid is lost per hour of
                        exercise. Tiredness is a sign of dehydration and result to a drop in activity. Cramps, heat
                        stroke, and stress are other consequence of dehydration. To stay hydrated throughout the
                        session, do the following-
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Drink water hours to the commencement of your session.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Drink not smaller than 500 ml (2 cups) at least an hour prior to your session.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Take in about150 ml after every 15 minutes while exercising.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                During breaks, drink water
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Rehydrate yourself by drinking more water at the end of the session.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b><i> Exercise safety and hot weather</i></b> - You subject your body to strain, heat-related
                        sickness
                        including heat and sunstroke. They crop up when the body cannot maintain a low temperature. At
                        this point, sweating cannot on its support a body cooling. Nausea, cramps, weakness, headache,
                        and irritability are symptoms. To prevent heat-related stress, drink water before and after the
                        session, wear light colored and loose kits, wear full-length clothing including long sleeves and
                        trousers, choose a cooler period- evening and morning, avoid alcohol, or tea before or post
                        exercise

                    <li>
                        <b><i>Exercise safety and cold weather</i></b> - The muscles are prone to injuries during cold
                        weather. So
                        put on warm clothing. Double layer dress code is ideal for trapping warm. Spend enough time
                        stretching and warming up before exercise, drink water because low temperature increases fluid
                        loss. Even at cold weather, sunburnt is still possible, so remember your sun protection
                        technique.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b><i>Rest intermittently and recover</i></b> - Your body will intimate and give you the needed
                        clues to
                        determine when to quit. Is your knee a bit achy and pain lasting more than the advised 24 to 48
                        hours or could it be that fatigue has set in? Then you should consider a rest and recover. It
                        pays to rest as the body benefits significantly from it.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Despite taking precautions and observing safety measures, an accident is inevitable. You can pull a
                    muscle or sustain an injury of any degree during a session. If this happens, think first aid.
                    Utilize a sling, brace or a sling to hold the affected area. Remember and adopt RICE. R- Rest the
                    injury, I- ice the affected body part to reduce bleeding and swelling, C- compression bandage may be
                    ideal to use to restrict swelling, E- Elevate the wound above heart region to decrease swelling. Use
                    Ibuprofen or any other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. If pains persist, see a doctor
