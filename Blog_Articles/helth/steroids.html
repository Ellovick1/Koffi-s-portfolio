                <h3>
                    The Benefits of Steroids - Presenting the Facts
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Evidence of the benefits of steroid is thought-provoking. This is because steroids in most cases
                    offer a temporary advantage. They usually lead to various degrees of side effects which are the
                    outcome of the much-debated benefits. Okay, let’s reiterate the facts behind steroids. Steroids are
                    important chemical compounds that have very significant roles in the functioning of our body. Just
                    as the synthetic versions of anabolic hormones which are synthesized in the lab, anabolic hormones
                    are also produced in our bodies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Three main hormones play a primary role in the development of muscle tissues, these are:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Testosterone
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Growth hormone (GH)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Insulin-like growth hormone factors (IGF): These are the essential intermediaries that
                        enhance the effect of growth hormones. Once the pituitary gland produces growth hormones, these
                        hormones enter into the bloodstream, and the liver is stimulated to produce insulin-like growth
                        factors (IGF)
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    So, anabolic steroid has a significant influence on the metabolic activities of our bodies.
                    Note: For you to live and function properly, metabolism which is a series of chemical processes in
                    your body must continue to take place. Moreover, these various chemical processes include anabolism
                    (the build-up of substances in your body) and catabolism (the breakdown of materials in the body).
                    If you come across people using the word ‘metabolism,’ it is a complex term which generally covers
                    the breaking down of food and the transformation of this food (so broken down) into a usable form of
                    energy which is needed for the body to function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though there are different views and opinions regarding the argument about the effect of steroids,
                    it is best we focus more and discuss the ‘benefits’ and the reasons many people take and use
                    steroids. Do not forget that most of the assumed benefits of anabolic steroids haven’t been proven
                    scientifically. Such assumptions are only based on a few case studies which have been carried out on
                    individuals instead of a larger sample size that is sure to give more precise and accurate facts
                    regarding the benefits of steroids.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We shall also try as much as possible to have a closer look at some of the numerous adverse effects
                    of steroids that results from the wrong use of anabolic steroids

                            <b><i>Treatment of Several Medial Conditions:</i></b> Primarily, steroids were produced and
                            used to
                            help patients who suffer muscle atrophy which result from illness. Also, steroids are used
                            to enhance testosterone level in patients that have low libido and to accelerate puberty in
                            individuals who can’t attain puberty naturally.

                            <b><i>Cut down Accumulated Body Fat:</i></b> Anabolic steroids are used to curb excess body
                            fat which
                            arises from an increased rate of metabolic activities. Research from scientific findings
                            shows that steroids are helpful in lipid oxidation due to its ability to oxidize fat. This,
                            in turn, led to the use of fatty acids in energy generation inside the body.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b><i>Increased Production of Red Blood Cell:</i></b> Anabolic steroids have been shown to
                            speed up the
                            rate of red blood cells production in the body. Red blood cells function in the
                            transportation of oxygen to the various organs and tissues in the body. So, once more oxygen
                            is made available to the muscle tissues, they tend to help an individual do harder work for
                            a longer time frame. This serves as the reason why many endurance athletes and fitness
                            enthusiast opt for anabolic steroid since it is sure to give them the needed endurance and
                            stability. This, they do despite the prohibition of anabolic steroids for sporting
                            activities.

                            <b><i>Speed Up the Rate of Muscle Recuperation:</i></b> Anabolic steroids are known to
                            regulate the
                            amount of cortisol produced especially when the body is stressed up. Excess cortisol
                            production in the body leads to muscle tissue damage, and it retards the rate in which the
                            body and muscles recover from stress. During exercise and other fitness activities, athletes
                            use steroids to increase the recovery and healing of injuries sustained. Also, healing to
                            muscular strain gets faster with steroids thus giving them better stamina during exercise.

                            of
                            steroids. Anabolic steroids are known to enhance testosterone level which is the primary
                            factors of muscle development and growth in the body. Most time, once an individual is using
                            anabolic steroids, the muscles keeps on developing rapidly even without any form of
                            exercise. Furthermore, incorporating training and other fitness activities gives the flesh
                            an exponential growth pattern.

                            performance through an increased energy supply, endurance, and stamina.

                            converting food materials such as fats and sugar into usable energy in the body), there is
                            bound to be a corresponding increase in appetite.

                <p>
                    Erythropoietin (EPO) is one of the most well-known types of steroid which is very popular due to its
                    enhancement effect on the red blood cells count (remember, red blood cells are the carriers and
                    transporters of oxygen to every part of the boy. When they are more in number in the body, they
                    improve performance and endurance during fitness exercises). Blood doping is another process in
                    which athletes have devised to increase their performance. During blood doping, an individual or
                    athlete removes some amount of blood from his body and gets it frozen (in a way similar to what is
                    done during blood donation and banking). After the removal of some amount of blood, the athlete then
                    replenishes the removed red blood cells through healthy diets and lifestyle, and when its closer to
                    a competition or event, they will go for reinjection of the removed and banked blood into their
                    body. This process aims to increase their red blood cells count which in turn will increase their
                    endurance during an anaerobic performance. Nevertheless, such practices get the blood thickened, and
                    this can lead to blood clotting, heart disease, pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lungs) or even
                    kidney damage. Hence, the aftermath of such practices is deadly.
