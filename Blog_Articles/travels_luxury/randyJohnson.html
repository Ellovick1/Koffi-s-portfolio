                <h2>
                    Randy Johnson’s Arizona Mansion Seemingly Approaches the Absolute Auction
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The baseball superstar, Randy Johnson has repeatedly been unsuccessful with the proposed sale of his
                    alluring home situated in Arizona. The Erstwhile fireball is set to make a final attempt on the sale
                    of his Paradise Valley, AZ, residence as he has scheduled it for an absolute auction. The extensive
                    property which is finished with about seven bedrooms, 12 bathtubs, and a remarkable 25,416 square
                    feet, a unit of land area equal to 4,840 square yards (about 0.405 hectares) offers a great deal.
                    Since the facility lacks a willing buyer, the edifice which was scheduled at the rate of $25 million
                    has repeatedly witnessed a downward price review since its emergence to the market in September
                    2014.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the moment, plans have been in an advanced stage to dispose of the property, and an effective
                    date is the end of January has been earmarked for sale. Irrespective the absolute auctioning,
                    acquiring this luxury home will not come as easy you may consider. To enter the bid, eligible buyers
                    will advance a deposit of about $100,000 into an account kept in trust by a third-party and evidence
                    of the fund displayed. Registration is online while bidding is scheduled to commence on January, 29.
                    By January 31, ownership and right over the property would be transferred to the highest bidders. A
                    luxury real estate is sought to oversee the exercise for an easy bidding process. Randy Johnson's
                    home is to go on the auction block.
