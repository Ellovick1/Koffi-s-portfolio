          The Benefits of Renting Tents for Your Event
        </h2>
        <p>
          Are you preparing to host an outdoor event, of any kind? If yes, then you will require some kind of cover over
          your guest. You must think of renting a tent to protect you and your guest from the inclement of weather.
          Aside from sheltering you from rainfall and sunlight, tents provide the fun element, cool atmosphere,
          comfortable and conducive space that is just appropriate to set the tone for the event even from the very
          beginning. Still, considering whether or not your next event could see the presence of tents? Here are some
          benefits of a tent to ponder on.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Little or no stress</b>
            <p>
              Organizing an outdoor event come not with stress. One thing is for sure; a few days to the event, anxiety
              sets in. Your consciousness about the weather heightens. The thought of it raining or not raining filters
              through your mind. Mother Nature has ways of making you worry. But while nature does its work, you can do
              yours by renting a tent in advance to be sure of dry space to keep your visitors until the rain stops if
              it eventually does. This way, your guest does not have to crowd your home or get muddled under some sought
              of trees or umbrellas.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Rent gives Comfort</b>
            <p>
              Rain is just but only one of the vagaries of weather which the tent will shield you and your visitors
              from. Whether it is the cold rain or the hot sun, hanging out under any of these conditions could be
              hurtful. This is why you need a tent. It avails you of a properly shaded space which is much delightful
              and pleasing to sit, dine, and merry with your guest.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b> Lightings and decorations</b>
            <p>
              Tents add to the character and atmosphere of your event. It gives a relaxed ambiance. That open space in
              your backyard can be turned into some sought of a magical venue with colorful lightings and decorations
              that suit the occasion. Do you know that tents come in styles and each style arrives with its accessories
              including windows, ceiling treatments, and walls? All these enable you to develop or make something
              unique. A tent festive can also be made by introducing some flowers or plants as a landscape to improve
              aesthetics.

          </li>
          <li>
            <b>To get the Privacy You Desire</b>
            <p>
              Still not convinced of the benefits of tents? Here is one more for you! The tent gives you the privacy you
              desire. An event that is organized just in the open feels spread out and vast but with the tent, the area
              is defined, smaller, and confined enough to make your guest stay together. It demarcates the outside world
              from your event. This is particular for intimate ceremonies such as a wedding. How would you feel to be
              gazed at by passersby and neighbors during a wedding event in an open space? I take a guess; Awkward. Yes,
              you will feel awkward; so, to make your event a bit personal, think of getting a tent.

          A Marquee is a big kind of tent often used as temporary housing. A Marquee can be put into numerous uses
          including fairs, large weddings, circus, banquets, worship centers, banquets, revival, and corporate
          entertainment programs. Typically, the Marquee is finished with canvas. New and recent tents are likely to be
          made of Polythene or PVC for increased quality. You can get the Marquee up to about 20 feet (6.1 m) wide. Some
          Marquee especially those that measure up to 30 to 150 feet (9.1 to 45.7 meters) widths are costly and can be
          very technical; requiring specific tools and skilled personnel to put up. Numerous companies have relatively
          great size; (9 m to 45 m wide) marquee. However, these tents are erected and maintained by trained experts.

        <p>
          The canopy tents area is suitable for public functions including community day ceremonies, fairs, and
          carnivals. In most cases, these tents do not need to be aesthetically alluring. The main essence of the canopy
          tent is to shield you from rain or sunlight. Canopy tents do not arrive with a high peak and owing to the
          size, the style of the roof could be flattened out. Oftentimes, canopies are lightweight and by their make are
          not furnished with sidewalls and cannot withstand heavy wind and rain. Canopies that are smaller in size are
          designed for smaller or backyard functions. For those seeking quality at an affordable cost, the canopy tent
          is economical. Most times, they are simple to erect and can be put up even by the client.

        <p>
          For good reasons, the traditional pole tent has been constantly put to use by many individuals. The
          traditional pole tent fits almost all types of events. They are finished with high peaks and arrive in varied
          width, and sizes from 20 to 80 inches. The traditional pole tents are fancied for corporate events, wedding
          ceremonies, etc. Most times, they can be made beautiful and elegantly decorated by using pole skirts and
          fabric and at other times, used as they arrive; mostly for casual functions. One setback of this pole is that
          large footprints are needed to enhance staking. Staking is essential for installation, however, the center
          pole and those inside the tents obstruct views. The traditional pole tent also has sidewalls and arrive in
          various designs. If required, the clients choose from the options available for installation.

        <p>
          Typically, the Sailcloth tent has peaks that seemingly appear sculpted. They are finished with eaves in fabric
          which are translucent. This improves the atmosphere and provides warm natural light for the daytime event
          while it glows during an evening party. Tent Rental Service Boston has in stocks Sailcloth tents that are
          completely waterproofed and finished in ways that guarantee an element hitch-free party. The poles are
          aesthetically designed; some with fruitwoods to match the appearance of the tent. You can get the Sailcloth
          tents either as a pole or frame type. A height at two different points known as the King and Queen poles forms
          the basic attributes of the pole typed tent. The Sailcloth tent now surges in demand owing to its high
          distinction and quality.

          tent quickly but to be put into long term usage. The structure tents do not come with the center poles nor do
          they have heavy metal frames to guarantee wind resistance. More so, their erections aren’t supported with
          ropes nor stakes. However, the structure tents have sidewalls and this acts as a support system.

        <h2>
          What to Consider When Choosing a Tent
        </h2>
        <p>
          Before choosing any of the above tents, here are some factors to be considered.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b> • The Cost:</b> Unlike the less costly tents that are rather heavy, not durable and cannot withstand water
          tension, the expensive counterparts are lightweight has high water stress capacity and are durable
        </p>
        <p>
          • The need for the tent: To use any tent, consider the size. How simple is it to pitch the tent? What will be
          the duration of usage? A day, week, or months?
        </p>
        <p>
          • Be conscious of the Season: Tents that may be ideal to use during the winter may not be ideal during the
          summer. Most tents come with labels and inscriptions by the manufacturers. A tent that is labeled:
          “One-season” meets only the needs of the summer and can withstand light showers while a tent that is labeled
          three-season can meet the demand of the autumn, summer and spring. This means that it is capable of weathering
          fairly heavy rains, and light snow. Others are labeled 4 seasons: This is ideal for winter and all extremes
          weather
        </p>
        <p>

          • Size of tent: What are the ages of your invitees? How many invitees are you expecting? Answers to these
          questions will help in deciding the size of the tent and the features to seek for in the tent.

        </p>
        <p>
          • Tent color: For some functions or events, there is the need to tone down the visual influence of the tents.
          Some functions require colors with low visibility while others need highly visible or colorful pigments. More
          so, bright colored suits tents which the activities going on has an attendant high-risk implication. For
          instance; in case of emergencies, bright-colored tents are easy to spot. They are also essential in locations
          where oncoming vehicles may not see quickly low visibility tent. This may prevent it from running over the
          venue.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Installation time and effort: Certain kinds of tents demand less effort to set up. Others need a great deal
          of effort to do the same. As a point to note: a highly robust tent will require more effort and time to
          install and dismantle as well. Some designs, style, and finishing are easy to set up hence demand less time
          and effort while others are not
        </p>
        <p>

          • Weather conditions: A tent can either withstand cold weather or rainy situations. As earlier mentioned, it
          can be two, three, or a four-season tent. While the two-season tent suits the hot/warm temperature but fails
          to stand windy and rainy weather. Three-season tents withstand rain and wind but not heavy snow. The
          Four-season on the other hand can stand any weather situation. Note that the design, style, and other tent
          attributes may change depending on the seasons it can endure or cope with.
