          TRUMP GOVERNMENTS SURGES IMMIGRATION ASYLUM ORDERS AS CARAVANS CONTINUE THEIR TRANSIT TOWARDS U.S. BORDER
        </h2><br>
        <p>
          The US president Donald Trump is not in any way concealing his intention to conflate the caravan numbering
          over 7,000 migrants traveling towards the US border with other issues to reinforce support for Republicans in
          the imminent midterm poll. The government instituted new measures to rebuff asylum to migrants who come into
          the country illegally, adducing executive order to check long-standing humanitarian protections for foreign
          nationals arriving on American soil. The order which was ratified on Nov. 9 by Donald Trump is aimed at
          tackling mass migration through the US-Mexico border.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is Trump’s most recent effort to preclude caravans of the Central American immigrants in transit to the US.
          It does not pertain to immigrant children traveling independently. Immigrant solicitors argue that U.S. laws
          incorporate asylum protections to foreign nationals who arrive in the United States and coveying in words or
          gesture a fear of persecution, irrespective of the manner in which the gain access to the country. Soliciting
          asylum is legitimate under the US and international laws, regardless of whether an applicant gains access to
          the country legally or illegally. A senior White House officials confirm that the law assigns the president,
          full powers to stop “all foreigners or any class of immigrants” if he considers them a menace to the nation.
          In his executive order; Triumph fashions it in this manner; <br><br>
          <i>
            “The continuing and threatened mass transit of aliens with no basis for admission into the United States
            through our Southern borders has precipitated the crisis and undermined the decency of our borders. I,
            therefore, must take immediate step to safeguard the national interest and to sustain the effectiveness of
            the
            asylum system for legitimate asylum seekers who demonstrate that they have fled persecution and warrant the
            many unique benefits associated with asylum.”
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Triumphs government implored similar measure to rationalize its travel embargo on nationals from some major
          Muslim nations, which was welcomed by the Supreme Court after various repetitive amendments. Thursday’s
          pronouncement became imperative as an estimated 7,000 to 10,000 Central Americans transit north en route
          Mexico in caravan groups to US borders. Trumps has envisaged new approach to inhibiting them from accessing
          the United States and directed the movement of US troops in their thousands and equipment to support the
          border representatives. According to government officers, the Supreme Court has affirmed the president’s broad
          executive orders on such issue and that the curtailment which emerged as of Nov. 9 typifies a reasonable
          reaction as the nation’s immigration system is engulfed in what they identified as whimsical asylum assertion
          by migrants who cross in ways contrary to laws. <br>
          In the words of an administrative officer. <i> “Those who access the country between [official] ports of entry
            —
            i.e., illegally — are voluntarily and involuntarily contradicting the law. So it’s just essential to remind
            everybody that while all immigration laws do give people various forms of protection, the reality is that
            it’s a violation of federal law to penetrate our country in the manner that these illegal aliens are
            entering the
            country.”</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          In a separate statement from the Department of Homeland Security <i> “Our country is experiencing an unprecedented
          crisis on our Southern Border. Low standards for claiming a fear of persecution have allowed aliens with
          meritless claims to illegally enter our country, claim ‘credible fear,’ and then in many cases be released
          pending lengthy proceedings.”</i><br>
          Currently, US patrol teams who come in contact with asylum seekers that have penetrated the country illegally
          direct them to asylum officials for investigation; if their argument is deemed merit able; they are referred
          to immigration courts to proclaim the final verdict. This process may likely take years. Just like the many
          another effort to controlling immigration, immigrant advocates will probably file a suitcase to question the
          decision in the court. Not too long after it pronouncement, immigration legal practitioners were already
          identifying particular areas of the constitution it opposes.
