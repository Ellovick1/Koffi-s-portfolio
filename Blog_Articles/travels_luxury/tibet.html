                <h2>
                    A Tiebet Travel
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Regarded as the roof of the world; and dazzled by the sunset of the colossal Mount Everest, Tibet; a
                    unique cultural beauty is situated North of the Himalayas. As a natural beauty, it is home to many
                    visitors. Despite being branded by many as a difficult to access destination, it is entirely easy in
                    actuality. Below are a few hints to guide you as you prepare for a Tibet travel.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Autonomous Voyage to Tibet? It is a No</b></p>

                        As stipulated by the dictates of the Tibet Tourism Bureau, foreigners are not permitted to make
                        autonomous voyage into Tibet. Officially recognized travel agency is scheduled in China to offer
                        travel services and trip guide. You may also get your lodging needs fixed by the travel agency
                        as well. While in Tibet, your tour guide will be handy to escort you through site attractions.
                        Alternatively, you can connect with other organized tourist or demand a private tour guide from
                        your agent. At the end of the day's engagements, by the leave of your agent, you are at liberty
                        to move around municipalities like Lhasa, Gyantse, Shigatse, and Nyingchi.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>For Entrance into Tibet, an Entry Permit is Essential</b></p>

                        In addition to possessing an authentic international passport, and a Chinese visa, a Tibet entry
                        permit is also needed from international visitors. Foreigners cannot board a train or flight to
                        Tibet not until they acquire a Tibet travel permit often issued by the Tourism Bureau. To obtain
                        the permit, which takes about 15 to 20 days, notify a travel agency in China to process an
                        application for you.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Journalists, diplomats are not licensed to Travel to Tibet with a Travel Agency</b></p>

                        It is correct that your Tibet trip has to be scheduled by a local travel agency but with
                        exception to Journalists and Diplomats. Travel agency does not assist diplomats, journalist or
                        employees from the media. These sets of person seek permission and approval to enter Tibet from
                        the Chinese Foreign Affairs Office. Seemingly, it is irrelevant to apply for a China visa and
                        Tibet permit as a diplomat or journalist from an agent.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Check out Entry Options and Means into Tibet</b></p>

                        Direct flight into Tibet does not exist for international visitors with exceptions to Nepal
                        which borders with Tibet and China. Irrespective of your nationality, a transit by flight to
                        Nepal demands arriving first at Nepal or mainland China.

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Board a direct <b>flight</b> from Nepal to Tibet through Kathmandu to Lhasa Gonggar
                                International Airport
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                From Mainland China, direct flights exist from Beijing, Xi'an, Chongqing, Chengdu, and
                                Kunming into Tibet. Alternatively, you can fly in from Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Hangzhou
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Consider the railway as an alternative - Enter Tibet from mainland China cities by
                                rail through Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Chengdu, Chongqing, Lanzhou, and
                                Xining
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Between Tibet and Nepal is a route which was destroyed by an earthquake in 2015. At
                                the moment, re-construction is completed thus qualifying the road as an option for entry
                                into Tibet. A transit from Lhasa to Kathmandu by road is now possible.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>There is no age Limit, but be Conscious</b></p>

                        Age limitation does not exist for visitors and foreigners coming into Tibet. However, here are
                        some hints for you. For those planning a visit to Tibet with the aged and babies, there are no
                        basic facilities to cater for their health needs in remote locations. It will be a bit tedious
                        getting them to facilities in Lhasa if the need arises. Further, owing to high altitude, high
                        blood pressure and heart disease patients are often advised to reconsider visiting Tibet.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>The Annual Tibet Closure</b></p>

                        In order to commemorate recent Tibetan historical events including 10th and 30th March, Lhasa
                        and all other Tibet Autonomous Regions (TAR) are often closed a during this dates. This
                        government imposed closure commences in early February to March end annually. International
                        visitors are not expected to travel to Tibet Autonomous Region during this period. Travel
                        Permits processing re-start every first Monday in March.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Ideal Travel Periods</b></p>

                        An understanding of when to visit Tibet is crucial. A Tibet travel is best-done during early
                        April through mid-June and also mid-September through November end. During this period, the
                        temperature is relatively mild so that you can be sure of dry, bright and good mountain sights.
                        More so, December through Mid February could also be appropriate for a Tibet travel

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Movements within Tibet</b></p>

                        Foreigners are not authorized to use general transportation while inTibet Municipalities. While
                        in Lhasa, public transit can be used, but the movement to other areas of Tibet are done on a
                        personal basis. On private provision, your travel agent would have to schedule a professional
                        driver to move you around town. Most times, these agents arrange minivans and minibusses for
                        organized visitors (small and large group respectively)

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Some Locations and Attractions are Restricted</b></p>

                        Not all places and attractions are opened for visit to international visitors in Tibet. Your
                        trip agency will provide you with an overview of places to visit while in Tibet but for a start,
                        check out the following locations with their requirements for entry.
