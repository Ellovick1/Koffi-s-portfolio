                   Golfers Elbow Pain; meaning and description
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Golf Elbow which is otherwise known as epicondylitis is a medical condition which occurs when
                    the inner side of the elbow is inflamed. This inflammation arises when the muscles of the forearm
                    usually the pronator and flexor muscles become attached to the medial elbow.
                </p>
                    <h5>
                        What causes Golf Elbow Pains?
                   </h5>
                <p>
                    The golf elbow pains are caused by any activity which continuously stresses the muscles. These
                    activities involve actions such as; gripping, flexing, swinging, backswing. It is not restricted to
                    only the Golfers; it can arise from activities requiring the overuse of the flexors, including poor
                    posture while working on the computer and from other manual labors. The degree of inflammation may
                    differ from person to person. In the early stage, the pains are mild but become worst in the later
                    stage.

                        Can doctors fix golf elbow Pains with Stem Cells
                   </h5>
                <p>
                    Before now, surgical procedures, braces, and medications were the only options for managing the
                    golfer's elbow pain, but since the emergence of safe and effective adult stem cell, golfers elbow
                    stem cell therapy is now an alternative to patients. Today, doctors can fix the golf elbow pains
                    with stem cells and many patients can opt for stem cell therapy as a better option for invasions. It
                    is an easy and much faster way of solving challenges with fewer complications.

                    <h5>
                        How to fix the Golf Elbow Pain with Stem Cells?
                   </h5>
                <p>
                    The use of stem cells to treat golf elbow pain is a simple procedure. Doctors combine the stem cells
                    with Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP). To do this, concentrated platelets are extracted from a centrifuged
                    sample of the patient blood and subsequently mixed with stem cells. The mixture of blood platelets
                    and stem cell is then injected into the damaged joints and tendons of the medial elbow. The Platelet
                    Rich Plasma helps to initiate and energize the growth factors to create new cells. The objective of
                    the therapy is to restore and repair the structural vigor of the elbow. Mainly, the injection is
                    done to the medial attachment of the <b><i>flexor carpi radials, pronator teres, flexor carpi
                            ulnaris</i></b> , and
                    palmaris longus. This injection with stem cell treats all aspect of the pain and induces a
                    self-healing mechanism for the damages done to the elbow by stress.

                        Is Golf Elbow treatment with Stem cells Risky?
                   </h5>
                <p>
                    Yes, treatment of the golf elbow pains with stem cells is quite a safe option. It produces clinical
                    outcomes that are better than other traditional medical procedure and within a small duration.
                    Improvements are noticed within 2 to 3 weeks post injections. Sometimes, between 1-2 treatment dose
                    is required for a full recovery, and this depends on the severity of the pain.

                        Stem cell therapy and Surgical Procedure; which is best?
                   </h5>
                <p>
                    Stem-cell therapy is an ideal alternative for people with degenerative disease. An invasion has to
                    be performed if by surgical procedures. Mostly, this method does not always bring the desired
                    result. There may be a risk of infection and other related complications, including constant limited
                    joint motion and may require the patient to undergo physiotherapy for a minimum of three months
                    post-surgery. However, with Stem-cell therapy, the negative side effects which are associated with
                    surgical procedures can be avoided. It is an innovative technique which works by using the natural
                    self-healing abilities of the body to manage situations. It can be used to treat joints and elbow
                    issues. There is absolutely no risk of infection or limited joint motion with stem cells.
