                    10 Established Benefits of Green Tea
                </h3>

                <!-- place content here -->
                <p>
                    Globally, green tea is recognized as the most nutritious and beneficial beverage. Its primary
                    constituents include antioxidants and nutrients that influence the body in a higher dimension
                    including brain development and enhancement, burning of fat, a reduced risk of cancer amongst other
                    remarkable advantages. Scheduled below is some health importance of green tea which is confirmed and
                    documented by studies.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    1. Bioactive compounds in Green Tea enhance health
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Green tea contains numerous compounds derived from the parts of the plant including the leaves. The
                    tea has high a high level of polyphenols which is anti-inflammatory and anticancer. The catechins
                    component of the tea is a natural antioxidant which avoids cell destruction. The element catechin
                    has the capacity of decreasing the development of free radicals which is an anti-aging factor. Quite
                    essential as well is the presence of EGCG (Epigallocatechin Gallate) which prevent various diseases.
                    Some brands often the lower type can do contain surplus fluoride, so when next you are in the market
                    for your green tea, choose the higher brand. However, the health-related importance of the lower
                    brand green tea still surpasses its risk.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    2. Green Tea and the Brain Improvement Function
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Not only does it make you conscious, but green tea also makes you sharp and alert. The active
                    component more here is the caffeine a known stimulant. The stimulating effect in green tea is just
                    in contrast in coffee. However, the amount is right enough to give you the needed mental alertness.
                    Caffeine interferes with Adenosine, a neurotransmitter to improve neuron capacity and attentiveness
                    of the neurotransmitter including dopamine and norepinephrine. It has been widely investigated and
                    received increasing attention with improved and positive outcomes especially with regards to the
                    functionality of the brain, mood, memory, and alertness. Aside from caffeine, the green tea also has
                    amino acid as a component. L-theanine is an amino acid which improves the blood-brain and the
                    functions of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, an antianxiety effect. Dopamine is more
                    effective, and the development of the alpha waves in the brain is made optimum. There have been
                    reports by many people on improved energy stability on consumption of green tea against coffee.

                <h5>
                    3. Green Tea and Fat Burning capacity
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Green is one ingredient often outlined as fat burning addictive. There is also evidence of its
                    ability to invigorate metabolic rate in human controlled trials. In a related study engaging about
                    ten men, green tea was found to improve energy by 4%. Fat oxidation was enhanced by 17% in another
                    similar study implying the ability to burn fat. Improved physical activities, availability of energy
                    and enhanced performance to about 10 to 12% have been associated with caffeine components in green
                    tea.

                    </h5>
                  
                <p>
                    Regarded as the world’s dominant cause of death, Cancer is unconstrained cell growth. Oxidative
                    damage has been recorded as a driver of cancer. However, antioxidants component acts as a preventive
                    mechanism. Green tea is an outstanding antioxidant. Therefore it reduces the risk of cancer
                    including breast, prostate and colorectal cancer.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Breast cancer: A meta- investigational survey documented that women who ingested green tea
                        possessed 20 – 30% reduced probability of coming down with breast cancer
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        b. Prostate cancer: A related study documented that men who frequently drank green tea had 48%
                        less risk of coming down with prostate cancer, a common sickness among men.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        c. Colorectal cancer: In another study, a 43% chance of not developing colorectal cancer was
                        recorded among people ingesting green tea.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Apparently, those who ingest green tea are less likely to be affected by cancer of any type.
                    However, there is a need for further research to verified already existing outcomes.

                    dementia. A second primary neurodegenerative disease and necessitates the non-functioning of the
                    dopamine developing neurons in the brain. Evidence-based on studies on the catechin component of the
                    green tea shows that it has a protective impact on neurons and reduces the likelihood of Alzheimer’s
                    and Parkinson’s

                    Catechin, a component in green tea possesses biological consequences. The outcome of related studies
                    shows they can destroy bacteria and impedes viruses such as the influenza virus and can reduce the
                    likelihood of infection. Bacterias such as the Streptococcus mutans which is domiciliary in the
                    mouth is the dominant cause of cavities and decay of the tooth. A related study also documents that
                    Catechins, the component in green tea impedes the development of Streptococcus mutans. The green tea
                    is related to enhanced teeth health and reduced likelihood to be infected.
