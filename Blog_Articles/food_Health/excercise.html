                    Exercise and Diabetes
                    </h3>
                <p>
                    Aside from nutrition and medication, physical exercise has been considered as one of the fundamental
                    options for treatment of diabetes mellitus since the past 100 years ago. Diabetes mellitus is a
                    persistent metabolic illness, characterized by a surging blood-glucose level either as a result of a
                    relative insulin deficiency or insulin resistance or both. Consequently, it may result in glycation
                    of tissues, and acute metabolic inconvenience. In other cases, it damages critical body organs and
                    causes acute severe health deteriorations. According to the global research study, there is an
                    increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus and continue to grow at an alarming rate annually.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Symptoms of diabetes include frequent urination, increased thirst, loss of weight, general body
                    fatigue, consistently having a dry mouth and itchy skin, blurred vision, weak erection in men,
                    miscarriages in women, etc. Health expert predicts that the most vulnerable people to diabetes are
                    those with traits of this disease from family background, those with high blood pressure and stroke
                    inclusive which could later lead to other health complications like kidney failure, heart problem,
                    total blindness, and death.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Seemingly, there is a need for proper management to diagnose and treat diabetes mellitus and its
                    associating complications. Diabetes Mellitus is classified into two basic categories to include the
                    insulin-dependent commonly known as type 1 (T1DM), and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus
                    otherwise called type 2 (T2DM). Evidence from studies and medical professional outlines diabetes
                    management strategies to include the use of modern medicines, alternative or herbal medicines and
                    exercise management therapy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This array of management strategy impacts positively on the illness. However, the side effects of
                    medications are also increasingly enormous thus; cannot be overlooked. This makes exercise an ideal
                    treatment option for Diabetes Mellitus. To date, the place of exercise in the control of diabetes
                    mellitus is extensive. Globally, researchers have considered the importance of exercise to diabetic
                    patients, but admittedly, there is a lack of interest in performing exercise amongst diabetes
                    mellitus patients. The need for proper understanding of this concept becomes imperative.

               <h5>
                    Exercise and the Diabetic Patient
               </h5>
                <p>
                    Exercises are physical activity intended to improve the strength and fitness of an individual. They
                    could be planned, structured, intentional and repetitive movement of body parts to achieve a good
                    physique. Owing to the benefits accrued to the body, exercises are recommended to everyone including
                    patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. Aerobic and resistance exercise are primary therapeutic
                    effects towards diabetic mellitus.
                </p>
               <h5>
                    Aerobic Exercise and T2DM
               </h5>
                <p>
                    Aerobic exercise enhances oxygen utilization and improves cardiovascular and respiratory functions.
                    Aerobic exercises are considered as excellent therapeutic options for the management of T2DM. It is
                    essential for the physiological processes of the body and lowers the risk factors in insulin
                    resistance diabetes Mellitus. Exercises in this category include cycling, treadmill, rope jumping,
                    walking, swimming, rowing, running among others. Moderately, they give support to blood pressure in
                    diabetic neuropathy patients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, intensive aerobic exercise improves the physiological parameters including glycemic
                    control, fasting blood glucose level and lipid profile. It rehabilitates the endothelial function
                    and slows down arterial stiffness; a precursor for cardiovascular complications in T2D. Apparently,
                    exercise enhances increase glucose uptake through the glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) to the skeletal
                    muscle during the exercise account for reducing blood sugar level in diabetic patients. The death in
                    insulin receptors weakens glucose uptake and GLUTA translocation but could be restored by exercise
                    therapy
                </p>
               <h5>
                    Resistance Exercise and Type 2DM
               </h5>
                <p>
                    The resistance exercise effectively manages glucose and low insulin resistivity to T2DM. Just as the
                    name, the resistance exercises are activities undertaken against a resistance. Exercises under the
                    resistance exercise include weightlifting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In contrast to the aerobic exercise, the resistance type depends on the apparatus. T2DM benefits
                    from therapeutic regimes of the resistance exercise and this include As scheduled by the aerobic
                    exercise, the resistance is safe for elderly insulin resistance diabetic patients. They improve the
                    sensitivity of the insulin, daily dissipation of energy and life quality. Resistance exercises build
                    the muscular strength, lean mass and the bone density which is often a precursor for functional
                    status and glycemic management. They are also responsible for the prevention of the sarcopenia and
                    osteoporosis.
                </p>
               <h5>
                    Exercise and Type 1DM
               </h5>
                <p>
                    Basically, all the levels of exercises consisting of leisure, sports, relaxation, and competitive
                    shows and entertainments can be carried out by patients who have type 1 diabetes who are devoid of
                    complications. More so, the patient’s must possess an excellent blood glucose control. The capacity
                    to regulate and modify the therapeutic routines including medical nutrition and insulin to ensure
                    safer participation has been noted vital management for these set of patients. Individuals. The
                    patients in routinely self-monitors and collate blood glucose data to verify and examine his or her
                    responses to the routine exercises.

                    <li>
                        Diabetic adults should undertake about 150 min or more of moderate-to-intense exercises weekly
                        ideally spanning at least three days/week, with no more than two consecutive days without
                        exercise. For younger and more for patients, fewer duration, minimum 75 min/week of vigorous

                        • Both aerobic and resistance exercise are recommended for most people with diabetes. Walking is
                        often the most popular and most feasible type of aerobic exercise in overweight, middle-aged,
                        and older adults with diabetes. For those who struggle with pain upon walking- due to
                        osteoarthritis, semirecumbent cycling may provide an alternative. For most middle-aged
                        individuals, moderately brisk walking on level ground or semirecumbent cycling would be an
                        example of moderate aerobic exercise, while brisk walking up an incline or jogging would be
                        vigorous aerobic exercise. Resistance exercise performed 2 or 3 times per week may provide
                        benefits that complement those of aerobic training- increased strength and vigor, reduced body
                        fat, increased resting metabolic rate.
