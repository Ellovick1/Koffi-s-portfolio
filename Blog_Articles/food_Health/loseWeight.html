                    How to Lose Weight
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gosh! How do I burn off some calories? How precisely do I fast track my weight reduction? In
                    response to this puzzle, many conceptions do prop up, eat less, drink that, run a bit more, and flex
                    your muscle every morning. Do they work? These and many others are some concern expressed my many
                    people in recent times. Are you in any of this category? If yes, this article is for you. Be
                    prepared to get those calories burnt off. Ultimately, weight is managed by hormones; you should
                    instead spend time lowering the degree of your fat building hormone “insulin.” This will do the
                    magic faster than you can imagine. So, are you prepared to burn off some calories? Here are a few
                    tips.
                 </p><br>
                <h4>
                    1. Opt for food with less dietary carbohydrate
                </h4>
                <p>
                    When it has to do with sugar and starch, look the other way. As supported by studies in times,
                    dietary food with little carbohydrate content has formed a more significant part of every weight
                    reduction campaign. However, other dietary components could still shade some calories. Reduction in
                    food intake has often been the basic advice for all, but to what extent does this help? Some people
                    can’t just eat less, should they stick to a schedule for a few days, sooner or later, they return to
                    the status quo. Eating all that comes their way. Low carb diets decrease the desire to eat more.
                    Without keeping track of the calories by counting, most obsessed people still take in fewer
                    calories.Hunger may be worsened by sugar and starch, but the desire to eat food reduces when they
                    are avoided. Needless counting calories, instead stay on a low carb diet. Evidently, a related
                    survey performed in 2012 documented that people on low carb diet lose about 300 more calories
                    routinely while resting. The sponsor of this project, a Havard professor, opined that the number of
                    calories burnt regularly on consuming low-carb diet equates approximately the calories ideally burnt
                    during rigorous physical activity. Similarly, a later study involving larger cohort affirmed this
                    position with various groups. It opined that the consumption of low carb food burns about 200 and
                    500 calories per day. Ultimately, low carbohydrates containing diet lowers hunger and reduces the
                    desire to eat more thus improving the fat burning capacity.
                 </p><br>
                <h4>
                    2. Eat when hunger calls
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Do not starve yourself as most people do especially while following the low carb diet schedule. As a
                    way out, many people tend to lower carbohydrate ingestion while they express worries fatty food. The
                    two sources of body energy; carbohydrates and fat are quite essential; the body needs at least one.
                    Circumventing fat and carbohydrate based diets will cause hunger, loss of vigor and exhaustion.
                    Under this situation, you can only withstand momentarily. You will consume everything. Ideally, a
                    more effective approach is to consume natural fat till you are filled up. Basically, consume the
                    following, Full- fat cream, Olive oil, Fatty fish, Bacon, Butter, Meat, Coconut oil, Eggs etc
                    Eat to satisfaction especially at initial state of the weight reducing schedule. The low carb diet
                    so eaten implies that fat consumed is used as fuel while the insulin level becomes lower. In this
                    way, your weight is burnt without starving. Many people eat three times a day while others do this
                    twice with snacks intermittently consumed between these meals. However, regular snacks implies the
                    accumulation of fats in your diet to improve satisfaction. Whatever makes you feel good, just eat
                    when you are hungry.

                 </p><br>
                <h4>
                    3. Eat Proper food
                </h4>
                <p>
                    A gaffe often common while trying to consuming low carbohydrate diet is being lured by the smart
                    marketers who are seemingly displaying low carb foods on their shelf. A proper low-
                    carbohydrate diet should be rooted in real food including fish, eggs, vegetables, butter, olive oil,
                    meat, nuts. Intelligent marketers are up at their best to halfwit you into patronizing their brands
                    and end up ingesting foods containing high carbohydrates. What is term as low carb bread most times
                    are bakes with grains and so are not low carb anyways. However, most brands will lure you into
                    patronizing such products with the saying that they are low carb. Chocolate branded as low carb is
                    often composed of sugar alcohols which are not recognized as carb by the producers.
                    Approximately, about ½ of them get absorbed to the body raising blood sugar and insulin. The
                    remaining carbs are then forced down the colon. They are a potential source of diarrhea and gas — a
                    few things you should avoid- Julian Bakery’s high carbohydrate low- carbohydrate bread, Akins
                    fairy-tale cookies, and the Dreamfields pasta fraud. As noted, the three companies aren't ideal.
                    They only lure you into purchasing their seemingly low carb food which in real times are junk and
                    containing high sweeteners, sugars alcohol, additives, and wheat flour. As a rule of thumb – Avoid
                    low carb type of high carb food such as cookies, chocolates, ice creams, pasta if you arent sure of
                    the components. Do away with products inscribed net carbs”, it’s a bait to lure you. Consider
                    consuming quality food, with minimally processed.
                 </p><br>
                <h4>
                    4. Do the Eating when hungry
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Discipline yourself to consume food only when you are hungry. Unnecessary food consumption retards
                    weight loses. Restrict non-essential snacking – Irrelevant snacks are potential issues waiting to
                    strike. A few traps typical to look out for include- Dairy commodities, nuts, and low carb baking.
                    Cheese and creams, salted nuts, sweeteners snacking on baked products, and cookies should be pushed
                    aside. Often, without being hungry, we are tempted to consume more of these products because of
                    their taste
                    You are at Liberty to skip a meal – You do not need to eat if you are not hungry whether breakfast,
                    lunch or dinner. When scheduling on a Keto diet, the desire to consume reduces particularly if you
                    have excess weight to burn. Your system may be actively breaking down the fat store. In the event of
                    this, be glad instead of lumping up the food you don’t require to your body, be patient and eat when
                    you are hungry. Eating frequently accumulates more calories and worsens the situation. Ultimately, a
                    sustainable way to lose weight quickly will be to consume food when we are hungry. Pay attention to
                    your body rather than focus on the clock.

                <h4>
                    5. Monitor and measure your progress
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Observing your weight loss may seem a bit awkward. This is because concentrating only on weight
                    could be misleading. You seem fascinated jumping on the scale, and climbing the balance. The truth
                    is, doing so increases your anxiety and questions the good intent. More so, the scale or the balance
                    could be reading some other thing entirely. It may be your bones, muscles or other internal organs.
                    The Body Mass Index (BMI) approach to weight monitoring isn’t an ideal approach to monitoring your
                    progress. You rather shade off fats and build muscles, but how would you verify this, if you are
                    only concern with assessing your weight? So the way to go is the waist circumference measurement
                    which evaluates the loss of belly fat. To do this, note the schedule below
                 </p><br>
                <p>
                    • Hung the measuring tape half way a bit over your belly
                 </p><br>
                <p>
                    • Breath out and relax
                 </p><br>
                <p>
                    • Let the tape sit appropriately without being too tight
                 </p><br>
                <p>
                    • Then measure, and observe the reading
                 </p><br>
                <p>
                    The table below shows ideally what is expected. So contrast it with your reading.

                <p>
                    Excellent Decent Too high
                    Women < 31.5 inches 31.5 – 35 inches Over 35 inches (80 cm) (80 -88 cm) (88 cm) Men < 37 inches 37 –
                        40 inches> 40 inches
                        (94cm) (94 – 102 cm) (102 cm) <br><br>
                        A reading in the excellent range is optimal, but mostly, they are not achieved. To the younger
                        individuals, it is, but it takes a great deal to have the middle-aged and elderly groups in the
                        decent class. However, before you commence this process of weight loss, measure your waist
                        circumference, and weight then repeat it on a weekly basis. This is for effective progress
                        monitoring. You can measure your chest, buttocks, legs, and arms if you wish. You are most
                        likely to have an alternating reading daily. Fluid balance and digestive contents are
                        responsible for this. So no worries, Focus on the long-term goal rather than now.
                 </p><br>
                <h4>
                    6. Be Unrelenting
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Wanting to burn all fats you accumulated over the years, most times a decade, in few days merely is
                    being unreasonable. To make things worst, you add starvation to it, thus endangering your health as
                    well. It does not work that way. This is a long-term campaign, and if you must succeed, it needs
                    patience. Here is how it works. On a stringent low carb diet, it is typical to lose about 2 – 4
                    pounds (1 – 3 kg) within the first week; This implies a pound (0.5kg) on the average per week. This
                    means 50 pounds a year.
                    Males of younger age rapidly lose weight than this schedule, two times quicker than postmenopausal
                    females who do that at a sluggish pace. Individuals on a low diet and those on a routine exercise
                    programme rapidly loss weight. Anticipate a weight loss peak — a period where measurements seem to
                    remain constant. It does happen for everyone. So, during this moment, keep calm and remain focus.
                    Things will eventually fall into place. In the long run, stay away from habits which would cause a
                    gain of weight the second time. Losing weight and returning to an initial habit which caused the
                    weight at first, will restore you to your former place and this time, it may be worst. It may be
                    difficult at first, develop new habits and be resolute, and you will eventually surmount.

                 </p><br>
                <h4>
                    7. Stay away from fruit
                </h4>
                <p>
                    I know this seems contentious, especially with the unique health-related benefits of fruits in
                    contemporary dietary space. As opined by many people, fruits are highly health-giving. The truth is
                    that fruits contain sugar about 10% in weight composition. Five portions of fruits daily equates
                    about the quantity of sugar present in 16 ounces of soda approximately 500ml. In contrast to popular
                    opinion, that sugar component in fruit is more or about 50% fructose and 50% glucose. Sugar in
                    fruits can stop the fat burning. It simply increases your hunger and retardates your weight loss.
                    For optimum results, do away fruits or better still, delight in it seldom
                 </p><br>
                <h4>
                    8. Jettison beer consumption
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Commonly termed as liquid bread, beer contains a high speed digested carbohydrates that can halt fat
                    searing. As an alternative, you can ingest wine – red or dry white), strong liquor such as whiskey,
                    vodka, soda water, lime or dry champagne. These drinks are considered best options because they
                    contain neither sugar nor carbohydrates. However, alcohol, when consumed in large quantity, reduces
                    the pace of weight loss. So be modest.
                 </p><br>
                <h4>
                    9. Circumvent artificial sweeteners
                </h4>
                <p>
                    In recent times, there is a growing consensus that sweeteners reduce calorie and consequently,
                    weight loss. Many people, therefore, substitute sugar with artificial sweeteners. As tenable has it
                    seems, studies have failed to show a relationship between artificial sweeteners consumption and
                    weight loss. Instead, evidence of increased appetite and the desire for sugary food is documented.
                    Sweeteners sustain addiction to sweets and causes make you desirous of snacks. There is no consensus
                    as regards the long-term effects of ingesting artificial sweeteners. If you intend to lose weight,
                    then jettison the habit of artificial sweeteners. In no time, your desire for natural sweeteners
                    will improve once you quit artificial sweeteners from junks.

                <h4>
                    10. Appraise any medications
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Most prescribed drugs influences weights. Insulin injectable- When administered at higher doses
                    hinders weight loss. To tackle your desire for insulin, adopt any of this approach. Whichever works
                    for you is ideal including- First, consuming fewer carbs since it directly reduces insulin. Second,
                    explore with metformin tablets about 2 – 3 grams per day, and third, try out tablets like Victoza or
                    Byetta.
                 </p><br>
                <p>
                    <b> • Diabetes tablets-</b> Insulin tablets such as sulphonylureas also cause weight gain. Minodiab,
                    Euglucon, Daonil, and Glibenclamide are in this class as well. Weight pain also could be caused by
                    diabetes tablets like Avandia, Actos, Starlix, and NovoNorm Victoza and Byetta reults to weight
                    loss, but long-term side effects is yet to be rcorded.

                <p>
                    • The oral tablet cortisone such as Prednisolone is also a typical culprit. In the long term,
                    cortisone also leads to weight gain when consumed at a great extent of about 5mg prednisolone/day

                    If reducing weight is back-breaking, even on a low carbohydrate diet, then be meticulous about nuts

                    responsible for retarding weight loss is a chief component of dairy product. Some protein components
                    in milk also produce insulin response with similar impact. Therefore, reducing the consumption of
                    dairy products quickens weight loss. Nuts contain a fair amount of carbs. Cashew nuts invariably
                    have the highest quantity of carb-with about 20% carbohydrate content by weight if you are on a
                    strict keto diet programme, with about 20 grams of carbohydrate ration/day. Peanuts also contain
                    10-15% carbs. So if you are looking to reduce some weight, then off the nut game.

                    A certain level of vital minerals and vitamins are required for the effective functioning of the

                    implication, vitamins intake, reduces our desire to eat, thus encouraging weight loss. Evidence by
                    way of scholarly studies attests to this fact. See the following. Three recent studies indicate
                    that, when compared to a placebo, a vitamin D supplement can decrease your fat weight or waist

                    In another related study in 2010, involving about a hundred women with weight-related issues were
                    broken into cohorts. The first cohort received multivitamins, the second calcium supplement and the
                    last, a placebo for about six months. The result showed no changes in weight of the women except the
                    cohort who received the multivitamin supplement. This cohort lost about 3kg more with their health
                    indices improved. Nutrient-rich food is a basic foundation of weight loss. The sufficient quantity
                    of vitamin D cant is derived from food alone. The advise has always been to supplement from other
                    sources. Seemingly, you can supplement your nutrients and mineral content by consuming the
                    multivitamin pill.

                    This is one efficient technique in weight reduction. It plays an essential role, especially at the
                    weight loss peak. This superb combo is termed the intermittent fasting, just like the name, it
                    implies no food at specific intervals. More typical of the option is the 16 – 8. Consequently, this
                    means 16 hours of fasting with sleep inclusive. In this technique, a cup of coffee or other
                    noncaloric liquid is often substituted for breakfast with lunch regarded as the first meal of the
                    day. 8 pm to noon of fasting equates 16 hours of fast. As often as you desire, you can arrange the
                    16-8 fast. For instance; maybe twice a week or a particular day of the week say every Thursday or
                    any day of the week. The frequency of the fast also gives the better result. Other kinds
                    intermittent fasting types abounds. Longer duration seems duanting but gives more effective outcome.

                    You may have expected exercise to be top on the list. Just like every other person, exercise among
                    all weight loss techniques is often given the uppermost pride of place. The picture is as said.
                    Imagine the participants take work leave for weeks or months; decide to go with a little proportion
                    of food with intensive exercise sessions sometimes about 40 hours as though it’s a full-time task.
                    This is definitely not helpful at all in the long-term. Ideally, the consequence of exercise on
                    weight has mostly been overestimated. Evidently, before exercising, there are other things which
                    must be handled of which case, exercise itself cannot do. If you have dealt with technique 1 to 12,
                    then increased activity will fast track your weight loss campaign and serve as an ideal bonus. For
                    instance, you may engage in long-distance work, play a sport of your choice, dance, cycle or any
                    other activity you enjoy. Exercise blows off glycogen reserves known as carbohydrates. For this
                    reason, after every work out session, it is advisable to consume a bit of carb without fear of
                    insulin level. More so, exercise possesses impressive benefits on hormones, and the non-weight
                    related benefits of exercise are numerous.

                    Have you engaged in tip 1 through 15 and you seem not to lose weight, then it's better you try a
                    more weighty option, “optimal ketosis.” Ketosis has been known to produce incredibly result
                    especially for people who have attained the weight loss plateau or peak even while on a low
                    carbohydrate diet. So what is the role of ketosis? Recall in previous techniques. First, you need to
                    eat low carbs diet. Low carbs diet decreases the volume of insulin thus causing the fat reserve to
                    release deposited energy. The implication of this is that; you desire to consume fewer calories than
                    you dissipate without feeling hungry. Consequently, your weight drops. However, to know if you have
                    derived the most favorable amount of hormonal effect from your low carb diet, you need to achieve
                    the optimal ketosis.

                <p>
                    Ketosis is a situation where the body has immensely high fat burning momentum. Body system including
                    the brain functions on fat through the ketone anatomy. Ketones are energy particles components in
                    the blood which operates as fuel to the brain after being converted to fat by the liver. For an
                    optimal functioning and production of the ketone, insulin amount must be low. Lower insulin implies
                    a high output of ketone. A well controlled and adequate ketone amount in your blood is evidence of
                    low insulin; a direct consequence of low carb diet termed as “Optimal ketosis.”

                    Many people share their concern of not having to hit the range they would like to even though the
                    follow strict low carbohydrate schedule. As you avoid carbohydrate-containing food, be meticulous
                    about your protein consumption as well. Protein consumption in large amount, the surplus protein
                    becomes glucose in the body. With the larger quantity of protein, your insulin level also rises and
                    so compromises the role of optimal ketosis. A way out of this is to consume more fat to
                    satisfaction. A common way of ingesting fat by many is “fat coffee” which entails the addition of a
                    tablespoon of butter to a tablespoon of coconut oil to the morning coffee. More fat makes you
                    satisfy ensuring that you ingest less of protein and carbohydrates. Insulin reduces while you
                    consequently attain the optimal ketosis. At this point, the weight loss plateau is bridled. If
                    ketosis is not useful after one month, then you have to understand that excessive carbohydrate is
                    not a component of your weight-related challenges and does not hinder your weight reduction
                    campaign.
                    To monitor your ketone level, acquire the gadget for measuring ketone level effectively and at

                    <b> a. The Older appetite suppressants-</b> Amphetamine- including appetite suppressants often
                    recommended
                    in the short term and cannot be put into long-term weight control. However, they are not licensed in
                    the EU, and possess side effect including heart palpitations, insomnia, and high blood pressure.
                    Most time, you may be addicted to it and so need other prescription to manage and control. These
                    specialized control drugs include, Adipex-P or Suprenza (Phentermine), Bontril (Phendimetrazine) and
                    Didrex (Benzphetamine. Their impacts are moderate and within a relatively short duration. It is not
                    often recommended to be used.

                    <b> b. The oily discharge pill - </b> An example is the Xenical. It is believed that the Xenical
                    prevents the
                    body from assimilation fat, so the fat passes through the body and is ultimately emptied in the
                    toilet. The side effect of this drug includes stomach cram — oily stool and uncontrolled bowel
                    movement. It does not match well with a low carb diet. As most doctors will say, do away wit this
                    drug.

                 </p><br>
                <p>
                    <b> c. The Stupid pill – </b> Under the stupid pill is an option worse than the Xenical termed
                    Qsymia.
                    Accepted in the US and disallowed in Europe, owing to the side effect. The Qsymia consolidates small
                    quantity of old Phentermine with portions of Topiramate; a drug that prevents seizure. Drowsiness,
                    tiredness, anxiety, balance issue, sedation, gait malfunctioning are some side effects. It causes
                    brain retardation. You wouldn't attempt this drug because you desire to burn off some calories. It
                    is not worth it.
                 </p><br>
                <p>
                    <b> d. The “meh” pills -</b> The pills (Belviqand Contrave) targets the brain receptor to manage
                    appetite.
                    Its output is moderate, about 6 to 8 pounds decrease annually with some regain later. Safety issues
                    and health-related issues including constipation, nausea, headache, risk of suicidal thoughts and
                    seizures are some side effects. The side effect is enormous, and so I wouldn’t try this pill.
                 </p><br>
                <p>
                    <b> e. The campaign champion-</b> The drug under this class is promising, and hastens weight loss
                    campaigns
                    tremendously. It is an injected version of a satiety hormone termed GLP-1. It reduces the rate of
                    excretion and communicates the brain a non appetite sensory. It is an ideal way of losing weight.
                 </p><br> <br>
                <p>
                    The drug is highly efficient if you are under the keto diet programme and perform even better when
                    taken at the period of fast. With an initial history in controlling blood sugar in type 2 diabetes,
                    Victoza possess a remarkable weight loss effect. Test on obsessed individual reveals a high
                    effectiveness of the drug with patient losing about 12.3 pounds (5.6kilos) more than placebo cohort
                    annually. Generally, pills do not easily burn fat. They are dangerous and not effective.
