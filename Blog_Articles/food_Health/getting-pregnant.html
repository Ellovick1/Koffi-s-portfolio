                    There is no gainsaying that partners must attain good health to achieve pregnancy. However, good
                    health is a necessary condition but not sufficient enough to guarantee pregnancy. In fact, couples
                    at their fertility prime even without fertility challenges stand only a 24% likelihood of conceiving
                    at the cycle. This implies that irrespective how excellent your health status, a high probability of
                    difficulty to conceive is imminent. Attaining pregnancy is back-breaking to some people and
                    effortless to others. Pregnancy may take up to a year for most couples and may persist even further
                    in others. Therefore, it is essential, to understand that your influence over the length of time to
                    conception is limited. However, be it as it may, there are a few actions you can undertake to
                    improve your odds of conception.

                        For Partners who are below 30 years of age and routinely engaging in sex, conception should
                        occur within 12 months. Couples above 30 years still seeking conception 6months later should
                        visit a doctor. Since fertility declines with aging, conception for women above 30 years may be
                        daunting. Women who are above 35 or is with endometriosis, STDs, Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,
                        miscarriage history, inflammatory diseases of the pelvic and other historical diseases should
                        also see a doctor.

                        Present yourself for examination – Furnish your physician with complete medication, drinks,
                        foods, herbs and supplements you took in historical times to ascertain the best possible action
                        for you.

                                Semen analysis and sperm test should be done for the male to verify sperm quality and
                                number. Additionally, a blood test is ideal to check the hormonal balance and an
                                ultrasound to examine sperm duct blockages
                            </li>

                                Typically, fertility test is ideal for the women. This test may include -Pituitary
                                thyroid, and other hormone levels during ovulation. Ovarian reserve testing, as well as
                                genetic examination, can be effected to identify inherited infertility issues.

                        the full range of treatment within his reach. Make your appointment today. Ready your list of
                        question. Before your visit, rehearse the questions over with your partner to be sure you
                        haven't missed out on anything including side effects and cost. Lay bay your expectations for a
                        possible treatment on day one.

                    <li>
                        Inquire about Intrauterine insemination (IUI). Usually performed a day post ovulation in
                        women, it entails inserting a healthy sperm from a donor or partner into your uterus. Semen
                        allergy, endometriosis, male fertility factors are some issues which may give rise to IUI. In
                        vitro fertilization may also be considered as an alternative.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Inquire about drugs for your situation. In most cases, fertility medications may be enough to
                        improve conception odds while Gamete Intra- Fallopian or surrogacy are still an option for
                        others. Typically, fertility drugs like Clomid could be used to stimulate the release of eggs by
                        the ovaries.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ask for and accept support from your partner and therapist. Infertility could instigate
                        depression, isolation, and anxiousness. It takes the support of both partners to endure and
                        withstand stress which preceeds it.
