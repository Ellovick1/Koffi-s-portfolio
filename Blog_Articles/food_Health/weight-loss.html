                    Our Top Picks For Weight Loss Foods Heading into the New Year
                </h4>
                <p>
                    All calories are never similar in composition. Various foods undergo diverse metabolic pathways in
                    the body. These pathways possess major effects on hormones, hunger and the amount of calories an
                    individual burns. Below are the most weight-loss enhancing foods in the whole world with scientific
                    backings.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    1. Chicken Breast and Lean Beef
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Meat has been unduly bastardized and demonized. Despite the lack of a concrete evidence to support
                    some negative claims, meat has been blamed for many health complications. Studies have shown that
                    unprocessed red meat cannot increase the risk of diabetes or heart disease (12, 13). Two major
                    review studies showed that red meat has no contribution to cancer in women while it only has a
                    little involvement in cancer in men (14, 15). The fact remains that meat is a weight losing food due
                    to its high protein content. Eating protein can make you burn about 80-100 calories on a daily basis
                    (16, 17, 18). Lean meats are the best alternative when you are on a high-moderate carbohydrate meal.
                    Fatty meals on the other hand are best if you are on a food that has less carbohydrate.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    2. Salmon

                    quality proteins and other important nutrients. Seafood in general are a rich source of iodine
                    (which is important for the proper function of the thyroid gland). Thyroid helps to maintain the
                    rate of metabolism optimally (7). Salmon is also a rich source of omega-3-fatty acids which helps to
                    reduce inflammation. Similar examples like Salmon are trout, herring, sardine and mackerel and they
                    have all been shown to have a significant role in curbing metabolic disease and obesity (9, 10).

                    for more calories (23, 24). Adding much fat to soup e.g., coconut milk and cream can greatly elevate
                    their calorie content. Soups are significant elements of weight loss diet. They can increase satiety
                    due to their high water content. Remember, to always stay away from oily or creamy soups.

                    now a welcomed food. Recent studies have confirmed that whole eggs don’t cause heart attack nor

                    are embedded in the egg yolk. Eggs are nutrient dense and they are filling. Eggs can enhance weight

                    vegetable salad since their high fat composition is capable of increasing the absorption of
                    carotenoid antioxidant the vegetables (25). Avocados also contain other healthy nutrient such as
                    potassium and fibre.

                    lead to weight loss of about 3.5 pounds which is equivalent to 1.6kg (43). These individuals were
                    also observed to have a lower resistance to insulin which is a metabolic abnormality involved in
