                </h3>
                <p>
                    The consumable seed of the Salvia hispanica, chai is indigenous to Central
                    America. The Chia is egg-shaped and gray in coloration having black and white patches.
                    Owi ng to the hydrophilic nature of the seed, it assumes a weight which is 12 times
                    higher than its usual weight when immersed in water to produce mucilaginous covering
                    which gives chia related cream and beverage a unique gel feel. Its diameter is about 1
                    millimeter (0.04 in). Chia seed is considered as one of the healthiest diets. It is
                    highly nutritious and conveys a whole lot of benefit to the brain and body as a whole.
                5 Based on scientific evidence, the benefit of chia seed is scheduled below-

                    1. Chia seed is highly nutritious with few calories.
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Chia has received outstanding acknowledgment for its ability to make available and
                    sustain energy. Consequently, chia is a long-standing term to describe strength.
                    Irrespective its important and historical antecedent as a unique dietary need, chia
                    seed just broke into relevance recently into contemporary day diet menu. In a couple
                    of years past, Chia has gained recognition and now sits on top as it is consumed globally
                    by all people who are particular about their health. Do not slander Chia with your tongue
                    because of its size; amazingly, here are the components of a tiny Chia seed. A one-ounce
                    (28 grams) serving of chia seeds contains:

                <p> Chia conveys just but a small number of calories about 137 and a gram of digestible
                    carbohydrate. The end product of the Fiber content in chia is good calories.
                    Negate this from the fiber, and you will be left with about 101 calories per
                    288grams of seed. For this reason, Chia is one of the most decorated nutrient
                    source and calorie</p>

                    Chia Seeds as an Antioxidant
                </h5>
                <p class="m-0">
                    <p class="mb-0"> Chia seed also plays the role of an antioxidant. The antioxidant
                    constituent of chia prevents the fats in it from becoming rancid.</p>
                    <img style="float: right; width: 20%; height: 10rem; margin-left: 10px;" src="/img/chia seed.jpg" alt="">
                    Though the importance of the antioxidant addictive is often contentious,
                    scholars seem to have a converging decision on the subject. Researchers opined that
                    there is a positive association between antioxidant in chia seed and good health.
                    Antioxidants are essential to prevent the production of free radicals, which can destroy
                    cell molecules and fast track aging as well as deadly diseases like cancer.

                <h5>
                    2. Chia as a source of protein
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Protein Apart from the benefit mentioned above of chia, the seed
                    contains a modest level of protein. About 14% protein of the weight
                    of the chia seed is protein. When compared with another protein source,
                    it is high. Having an incredible balance of essential amino acid, your body
                    can assimilate the protein very easy. Protein is vital and conveys numerous
                    health benefit including weight reduction, and dietary nutrients. Protein
                    decrease appetite, obesity, and the cravings to eat snacks by night. For
                    vegetarians, the chia seed is an incredible protein source.

                    3. Carbs in Chia Are Fiber
                </h5>
                <p>
                    An ounce (28 grams) of chia is the equivalence to 12 grams of carbohydrate.
                    Eleven of these grams are indigestible fiber. Fiber does not
                    elevate the blood sugar either does it demand insulin to be sent off.
                    Chia is of the Carb family, but its health-related influences vary from those
                    of other carbs such as starch and sugar. Chia is carb friendly. 1gram per 28 grams
                    is the proportion of carb content which digestible. Owing to the excellent solubility
                    of the fiber content especially when immersing in water, chia becomes gel-like and
                    quickly fill your belly. Conversely, since it improves fullness, but influences
                    absorption at a slow rate, the body then needs food less frequently. In this way, you
                    take in fewer calories. Beneficial bacteria in the intestine sustain themselves with the
                    fiber content of chia. Their 40% composition of fiber content by weight makes chia a chief
                    source of fiber in the world.
                </p><br>
                <h5>
                    4. Chia aids You Lose Weight
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Many health pundits opine that chia seeds assist in weight reduction.
                    The soluble fiber takes in a massive portion of water into your stomach,
                    thus increase fullness and retards food digestion. Many studies have verified
                    glucomannan, the soluble fiber which functions similarly, attesting to the
                    fact that it can reduce weight. Chia also decreases appetite and food intake.
                    A related study documented increased satiety with chia seeds consumption as breakfast
                    in the short-term while another supported an improved characteristic of chia seeds
                    on weight loss. Though chia seed in the diet may not lead to reduced weight, health
                    practitioners opine that it is an essential supplement for weight reduction. Another
                    lifestyle including sleep and exercise is also necessary. If added with food along with
                    rest and exercise were taken into consideration, chia seeds enhance weight loss.

                    5. Chia Seeds contains Omega-3 Fatty Acids
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Just as flax seed, chia seeds contain a high quantity of omega-3 fatty acids. As a
                    point of fact, chia seed has in store more omega- 3s than a gram for gram and salmon.
                    Note that the omega-3s in Chia are mainly ALA (alpha-linolenic acid), which does not
                    convey much benefit as it sounds. ALA is first converted into the usable forms
                    eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). In this form, the body
                    then uses it. Unluckily, humans cannot sufficiently convert ALA into these usable forms.
                    For this reason omega-3s cotton is a second best to fish oil and other animal sources.
                    According to studies, Aside DHA, chia seeds have the ALA and EPA
                    blood level improving capability. This is a concern because, DHA, is the chief
                    component of omega-3 fat. Thus experts regard chia seeds to be a low-quality omega-3
                    diet. For improved and adequate DHA to your brain and body and brain, consume fatty fish
                    daily or fish oil or opt for plant sourced DHA supplement if you are a vegetarian.

                    6. Chia Seed decrease the Risk of Heart Disease
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Chia contains significant fiber, protein, and omega-3s hence their likelihood to
                    fight heart disease. Scholars have verified this economic importance, but they seem
                    not to have a conclusive result. A study on effect chia seed on rats shows a lower
                    risk factor including inflammations, triglycerides, insulin resistance, and belly
                    fat. The likelihood of efficient HDL cholesterol improvement exist. According to studies,
                    chia seeds may lower blood pressure in people with hypertension, a massive risk factor
                    for heart disease. The bottom line is that chia seeds may affect heart health, but the
                    significant effect may not be obtained until some lifestyle and dietary varies.

                </h5>
                <p>
                    Chia seeds contain excellent nutrients just good enough for bone health
                    including phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, and protein. Calcium
                    component is quite significant; about 18% of RDI is contained in 1 ounce.
                    A phytic acid constituent of chia seeds slows down calcium digestion to a certain
                    level

                </h5>
                <p>
                    Elevated fasting blood sugar levels are related to surging risk of some chronic
                    infection such as heart disease. However, momentary spikes in blood sugar levels
                    at the end of meals may pose negative health effects if they are abundant on a
                    daily basis. According to studies, chia seeds may enhance insulin sensitivity and blood
                    sugar management and sustained blood sugar levels after every meal in animals. Similarly,
                    studies on humans, show that consuming chia rich bread reduces the after-meal blood sugar
                    increase when compared with bread without chia.

                    to the risk of chronic inflammation. However, some healthy diets may slow down inflammation
                    A study on 20 diabetes individuals which lasted 3-month documented that consuming 37
                    grams of chia seeds routinely lowers the inflammatory indices hs-CRP by 40%. The
                    cohort who was placed on wheat bran had no outstanding benefit. Another study failed to
