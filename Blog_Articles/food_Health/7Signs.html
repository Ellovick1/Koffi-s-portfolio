                <h3 class="text-center">7 Signs that your Brake Pads Need to be Inspected</h3>
                <p>When we think safety, especially in regards to vehicles, then the brake system immediately comes to mind. The need to examine and perform a routine check to the brakes is imperative. More so, it would be helpful should you understand the visible or non-visible signs that may suggest the need for brake maintenance. It would be best if you did this to be sure of the vehicular and passenger safety. As mentioned earlier, the brake is an essential safety component of the car.  It should function optimally. Ideally, no one desires the brake system to wear to the extent of breaking down entirely nor degenerates to metal-to-metal braking. Of course, should this condition will demand a rotor or drum replacement. So, it is costly, time wastages, and irresponsible to allow such an occurrence. The state of the operator, type of vehicle, brake lining material quality, and driving habits are a pre-cursor to wear and tear of brakes. </p>
                <p>Consequent on one or all of the conditions mentioned above, your brakes may require attention.  Being meticulous over issues of this nature will prevent or reduce the frequency drivers would have to perform a primary service.  Routine inspection will also reduce vehicular cost, car insurance charge, and significant challenges which may arise in the future. So, be sure that your brakes are in good condition. </p>
                <p>Do you know that several signs can signal the need for a brake inspection? If your response is “No” then, this article is for you. If your answer is “Yes” to the question above, then you still need to check this out, you may likely add one or two more things to your list. </p>

                <h5>1. Shrieking sounds, Vibrations and Wobbling sounds during Braking</h5>
                <p>Does your car make a grinding sound or shriek when the brakes are applied?  If yes, then this is most likely indicates the need to get your brakes checked. The noise you are hearing may probably be emanating from your pads. By their design, several brakes are bound to produce sounds or make a noise when they are severely worn. The noise may also be coming from the pedal or the rotor. Sounds from the rotor are a more severe indication. It is a condition which occurs when the brakes wear to the extent that the metal which is apart each other makes contact. Do you need to go this long without servicing your brakes?  </p>
                <p>When the pads are completely worn out, the metal to metal contact produces a sound hence produce grooves in the brake rotor. Isn’t good. Furthermore, the grinding noise may be an indication that there is no lubrication in the car rear drum brakes. The brake shoe may be drifting on the contact points of the metal, and the backing plates as a result of rust. </p>
                <p>The smallest variation in the disc thickness can also result in a wobbly feel each time the brakes are applied. Wear from heats on road debris may stick to the piston and can prevent the pads from retracting back completely when the brake pedals are lifted. Sounds may also be as a result of damages to the brake components arising from wrong wheel lug nut fitting. There is a need for checks whenever you hear a noise. The severity and cost of repairs differ from one situation to the other. So, think checkup when you listen to sounds.</p>
                
                <h5>2. Brake Responsiveness</h5>
                <p>If your break is not making a sound, it does not mean all is well with the brake system. A potential issue may be locking around waiting to escalate. So, it would be best if you were very meticulous about it. However, how can the brakes be inspected when the system is not making noise? It is simple. Use the feel. Be attentive to the response you derived each time you initiate the brakes. Ideally, the feeling should be stable, firm, and the pressure mounted on the pedal should be gradual. If there is any other noticeable feel or response, there may be the need to inspect the brakes viz:</p>
                <p><span>•Soft or slushy pedal</span> : Is the feel of your brake pedal soft, slushy or mushy, then one of these conditions may be responsible.  There may be air present in the hydraulic brake lines, there may be an issue with the wheel cylinder, and the calipers may fall out of position or may be more fluid may be needed in the master cylinder.  Irrespective the reason for the squishy feel, soft brakes is an indication of a significant issue locking around to escalate. Inspect or seek the attention of the professional for an immediate inspection.</p>
                <p><span>•Brake system too sensitive and firm</span>:Most times, the brakes may grab just too sudden each time you apply the pressure.  The brake pads may require cleaning or replacement, the calipers may dis-align, or the disc may be bad. The brakes may not be grabbing suddenly but may need force to move it. It is not an ideal situation. If your brakes suddenly become too sensitive or become too firm, then there may be the need for an inspection.</p>
                
                <h5>3. A Pulling Sensation</h5>
                <p>What happens when you apply the brakes? Does the car resist? Does it instead desire to control itself; making a left and right turns while in motion or when you engage the brakes? If some or all of these are your experiences, then you’ve got to present the vehicle for inspection. Pulling may happen if the clipper is stuck inside the system resulting in friction on one of the wheels leaving the other in a perfect condition. In this way, the car tilts to the side carrying the stuck caliper. Nevertheless, it is vital that you understand that not all pulling are brake related. Some may be as a result of insufficient inflation of the tire. However, if you experience pulling, then present the car for a brake inspection.</p>
                
                <h5>4. Burning Smell While the car is in motion</h5>
                <p>A sharp or burning smell is probably the most significant indicator of a brake issue. A chemical-like odor which repeats itself after hard braking is an indication that the clutch or brakes have been overheated. Identify a safe location, pull over, and examine the parking brakes. Allow to cool and be sure it is sufficiently released to avoid a total failure. Smoke from the wheel may be as a result of the stuck caliper. Driving under such a condition is risky. Your car needs brake inspection.</p>
                
                <h5>5. Brake Light On</h5>
                <p>Another visible sign that the brakes be requiring an inspection is the brake light. Check to see if the red or yellow brake indicators on your dashboard lights up. If so, then you may consider going for an inspection. The light should pop up when the brakes are engaged. If the light comes up without the engagement of the brakes, then it’s time for an inspection</p>

                <h5>6. Engaged brakes on motion</h5>
                <p>Does it at any point seem as though the brakes always engaged even while you do not engage the pedal? The caliper may have gotten stuck or grimy. Dirt may have engulfed it to the point that it fails to be released. If the car seems rather fast with a dragging speed, then it is time for an inspection. The calipers are an essential component of the brakes and safety of the car. So, an issue with it can cause several other problems to the system.</p>
                
                <h5>7. Little or no brake pressure</h5>
                <p>Examine the extent of pressure to dictate if there is a need for an inspection.  Is your brake positioned lower than usual? Is it almost at the base or floor? Does it feel as if there is no response at all? Several issues could cause these. Insufficient fluid in the master cylinder, leakages and or the presence of water and or air in the hydraulic could be a cause.  Do you get any of these feels or response, if so, then you have to present your vehicle for inspection?</p>

                <p>Finally, Brake pads wear and get worn out with time, if you continue to procrastinate brake servicing even after you noticed any of the above mentioned signs, then you are probably getting yourself and that of your passengers into danger. Act and respond immediately.</p>
