                    Whey Protein
                </h3>
                    
                <p>
                    The building blocks within proteins differ from each other. So, all proteins are never equal. Whey,
                    a typical form of protein is known to be better than others. Whey protein powder is made up of a
                    wide variety of amino acids as such; they are absorbed quickly into the body (1). Whey protein
                    powder has been confirmed by various studies to help in muscle development, increase strength and to
                    cut down a high amount of body fat (2). Whey is more than a typical protein. It is made up of many
                    other nutrients with potential biological effects in the body.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whey protein powder makes a list as one of the most studied food supplement across the world. This
                    article is detailed enough to give you necessary information about whey protein power â€” the
                    definition of Whey Protein Powder, its functionality and the mechanism through which whey protein
                    powder can help an individual to achieve health and fitness target.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    What is Whey Protein?

                </h5>
                <p>
                    Whey protein is a term used to describe the combination of different proteins which are isolated
                    from whey. Whey on its own is the liquid component of milk which dissociates during the production
                    of cheese. Milk is made primarily of two types of protein; 80% of casein and 20% of whey. The liquid
                    portion of milk is where whey is found. During the production of cheese, the fatty components of
                    milk coagulate while the whey component of the milk is extracted as a by-product (3).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Have you ever opened a can or bottle of yogurt to see the liquid portion floating? If yes, that
                    volatile liquid is whey. Initially, cheese makers usually disposed of it until research proved the
                    volatile liquid to be whey and of high economic value (4). The moment whey is separated from the
                    whole milk during cheese production; it is subjected to different steps of processing which turns
                    out to be what everyone recognizes and calls whey protein (a white powder which is added to meals
                    replacements, shakes and protein bars (5).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alone, whey protein is not tasteful. This is why flavored powder such as vanilla, strawberry, and
                    chocolate are usually added to enhance its taste. When buying whey products, it is advisable to read
                    the list of ingredients, reasons being that some whey products contain some unhealthy additives such
                    as processed sugar. If your target is to add about 25-50g of protein to your daily food intake,
                    enriching your meal with whey protein powder can help you achieve this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Are you a fitness enthusiast or you need to lose some weight? Possibly, your meals may be lacking in
                    protein, taking whey protein can be of great help. Flavored whey protein powder can be used to
                    enhance the taste of healthy food recipes such as smoothies. An individual with lactose intolerance
                    as well as those who are allergic to whey is advised to stay away from whey although it well
                    tolerated by most people (6).

                    Do You Wish To Boost Your BCAA and Protein Intake? Whey Protein Can Help You

                </h5>
                <p>
                    The primary building blocks of the human body are proteins. Proteins help to build different parts
                    of the body such as; the skin, organs, hormones, neurotransmitters, tendons, enzymes, other
                    molecules and components of the body. The contractile elements in the muscles are also made up of
                    proteins. Amino acids (smaller molecules tied to each other in the form of beads arranged in a
                    thread) are the building blocks of proteins. The food we eat helps to provide some amino acids to
                    our body while the body produces other forms of amino acids. The essential amino acids are those
                    derived from the food we eat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some proteins supply the body with the nine essential amino acids, and whey protein powder is one of
                    such. Whey protein is also known to have a high amount of essential branched-chain amino acids
                    (BCAA) such as leucine and cysteine (7). Research has shown that leucine is the most
                    growth-promoting (anabolic) amino acid which cysteine is helpful in boosting the amount of
                    glutathione which is a cellular antioxidant (8, 9). In human, whey protein is found to lay a vital
                    role in the stimulation of growth. Facts have it that breast milk contains about 60% of whey
                    compared to cow milk which has only about 20% whey content (10).
                </p>

                    Types of Whey Protein: Hydrolysate, Concentrate and Isolate

                </h5>
                <p>
                    Many popular types of whey protein exist, but the striking difference among them all is the methods
                    employed in processing them.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b><i>Hydrolysate Whey Protein:</i></b> This type of whey protein is also called hydrolyzed
                        whey, and it is
                        usually digested first and gets absorbed into the body faster than others. Hydrolyzed whey
                        protein can raise the level of insulin to about 28-43% which is higher than what the isolate
                        whey protein can (11).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b><i>Concentrate Whey Protein:</i></b> This is made up of about 70-80% of protein, and it
                        contains some
                        amount of fat, lactose (milk sugar) and its flavor is the best
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b><i>Isolate Whey Protein:</i></b> This type of whey protein includes more than 90% of protein
                        with the
                        lower amount of fat and lactose. It is not rich in beneficial nutrients like the concentrate
                        whey protein.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Among the three categories of whey protein, concentrate whey proteins remains the best alternative.
                    Concentrate whey protein usually retains all its beneficial nutrients, and it is the cheapest.
                    Probably, the lactose and fat content of concentrate whey protein contributes to its pleasant taste,
                    and this makes many people choose it over the rest for people who are having a problem tolerating
                    concentrate whey protein with low fat and carbs, hydrolyzate and isolate whey protein can serve as
                    the best choice. Donâ€™t assume that because concentrate whey protein seems to be the most popular,
                    several research and studies have had also examined isolate whey protein.

                <p>
                    Increasing strength and muscle mass are the significant uses of whey protein supplements. Among
                    athletes, fitness enthusiast, bodybuilders and those who hope to enhance their fitness performance,
                    whey protein is a top-rated product.

                    <li>
                        <b><i>Rapid absorption:</i></b> Compared to other types of proteins, whey proteins tend to be
                        absorbed into
                        the body faster (15).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b><i>Triggers Hormones secretion:</i></b> Anabolic hormones such as insulin which helps in the
                        stimulation
                        of muscle growth are rapidly released by whey protein (12).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b><i>High Leucine Content:</i></b> Whey protein contains a high amount of the amino acid
                        leucine, and
                        leucine is known to stimulate the synthesis of muscle protein at the genetic and molecular
                        levels (13, 14).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b><i>Provision of body building blocks:</i></b> Whey proteins provide amino acids which are the
                        primary
                        building blocks of protein in the body, and this leads to increased muscular growth.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    When consumed before, during or post workout, whey proteins have been confirmed to increase muscular
                    growth. Post workout periods are the peak moments when muscle protein synthesis takes place (16, 17,
                    18, 19). Be it as it may, according to current research, the most important factor responsible for
                    muscle growth is the total amount of protein intake on a daily basis (20). Whey protein has been
                    found to have a better performance when compared to other protein sources such as soy (21, 22).
                </p>
                <p>
                    By comparison, whey and casein seem to share equal performance. Casein is found to have a longer
                    period of muscle stimulation compared to whey whose effect is temporary, but their new
                    muscle-stimulating effects are similar (23, 24, 25, 26, 27). Bear this in mind that, supplementing
                    your meal with whey especially when your meal wasnâ€™t lacking in protein content might not give you a
                    significant result. In a study carried out on older adults who have enough protein intake in their
                    meals and are into resistance training, no significant difference in muscle growth was observed
                    after supplementing their meals with carbohydrates or whey protein for 12 weeks (28).
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the above result, the perception that wheyâ€™s contributes to the strength and muscle growth
                    remains unconfirmed and such results usually vary from one individual to the other. Are you already
                    eating enough fish, egg, meat and other dairy products? Adding whey to your meal may give just a
                    minimal benefit.
                </p>

                Whey Protein May Enhance Weight Loss and Improves Satiety

               </h5>
                <p>
                    Proteins are well known for their weight loss enhancement effect. They can as well be the most
                    satiating macronutrients (29). Energy expenditure can be boosted by proteins to about 80-100
                    calories daily, and this can push people to eat about 441 fewer calories daily (30, 31, 32, 33). In
                    a study, it was deduced that eating about 25% of calories per day can reduce cravings to about 60%
                    and cut the cravings for late-time snacking to about 50% (34). With many benefits for weight loss,
                    taking whey protein is one significant way of increasing your daily protein intake. Studies show
                    that substituting other sources of calories for whey protein together with lifting weights is sure
                    to cause about 8 pounds (3.5kg) of weight loss while the muscle mass of lean muscles will be
                    increased simultaneously (35). Are you trying to lose weight? A whey protein supplement can be of
                    help to you both in building muscles and losing weight (36, 37).

                    Other Health Benefits of Whey Protein
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Whey contains many other beneficial nutrients. So, it is more than just a protein of high quality.
                    Some of such beneficial nutrients are; alpha-lactalbumin, beta-lactoglobulin, lactoferrin, and
                    immunoglobulins (38). Apart from just enhancing leanness, strength and muscle growth, whey protein
                    powder can offer other numerous health benefits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example of such benefits includes: minimizing the symptoms of depression and stress, lowering blood
                    sugar level and blood pressure (39, 40, 41, 42). Whey protein powder can also protect an individual
                    against cancer, increase the mineral density of bones, improves the functioning of the immune system
                    in HIV patients and other immune-compromised individuals (43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52,
                    53). Whey protein also helps to reduce the symptoms of hepatitis. The high amino acid and cysteine
                    content of whey protein seem to be the backbone behind most of the health benefits it offers.
                    Cysteine content in whey protein helps to increase the amount of glutathione which a primary
                    antioxidant in the bodyâ€™s cells (54, 55).
                </p>

                    Dosage and Side Effects of Whey Protein
                </h5>
                <p>
                    The most commonly recommended dosage of whey protein is 1-2 scoops, about 25-50g daily, usually
                    taken post workouts. Better still, it is best to follow the recommended serving instruction on the
                    product packaging. Remember, it might be unnecessary if you are adding whey protein to your meal
                    when it already has sufficient protein content. Concerns raised about proteinâ€™s involvement
                    osteoporosis and kidney damage are unnecessary. From research, protein has been found to enhance an
                    improve kidney functioning while protecting against osteoporosis (56, 57, 58, 59). More so,
                    individuals having liver and kidneys problems may have to consult a medical expert for proper advice
                    on whey consumption.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nausea, pain, cramping, diarrhea, flatulence, and nausea are common digestive complications related
                    to the excess consumption of whey. Where you cannot tolerate the common concentrate whey protein,
                    other forms of whey protein such as isolate or hydrolysate may be a better alternative. Most
                    preferably, you can just avoid whey protein and focus on eating other foods rich in protein. On a
                    general note, whey protein has an excellent record of safety profile, and many people have no issues
                    consuming whey protein.

                    Finally, if you need a healthy way of adding protein to your diet, whey protein is the best
                    alternative. It is a great source of protein which can easily be absorbed into the human body and
                    used efficiently. For people such as bodybuilders, fitness lovers, athletes, and individual that
                    desire to gain more strength and muscle mass while they lose fat, whey protein is particularly
                    important for you. Among the various sources of the nutrient, protein ranks highest especially when
                    fat loss and muscle gain is a goal. Whey protein appears to be a better source of healthy protein
                    than other types of quality protein.
