                    Having Sex during your Period
                </h3>
                <p>
                    While many people consider period sex as fascinating and are often amazed at myths and taboos
                    attributable to the experience, others merely berate the act. However, should sex life get muddled
                    by menstrual period? Cleary, the answer is NO. Mutually, if both companions give consent, then there
                    is absolutely no problem proceeding with the deed even while you bleed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Biologically, your hormones are excited throughout the duration of your period, and as such, they
                    prop up different feelings at different intervals including - the fatigue feeling, cramps, yearning
                    for sex and gosh, you are mega horny. Medically, there is no evidence supporting no period sex;
                    instead, you stand to achieve more from this experience. A few of the benefits are scheduled below.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b><i>Comfort from Cramps</i></b> - Menstrual cramps is a resultant consequence of the uterus
                        tightening to
                        release its lining. Shannon Chavez, a Los Angeles based psychologist, and certified sex
                        therapist documented that oxytocin, dopamine, and endorphins, the feel-good chemicals delivered
                        at orgasm act as natural painkillers to provide comfort to pains up surging from menstruation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b><i>Relief from Headaches</i></b> - Aside relief from menstrual cramps, period sex is believed
                        to relieve
                        headaches. A related study showed that about 70% of patients who suffered from a migraine;
                        detailed a moderate to total relief post sexual exploit. More so, in another study, a group of
                        women also reported similar outcome post sexual engagement.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b><i>Blood as a Lubricant</i></b> - During menstruation, incredible wetness is imminent. For
                        this reason,
                        period sex becomes more exciting. Lube is inconsequential since the moisture so provided serves
                        as an excellent lubricant. According to Carlen Costa, a sexologist and relationship pundit,
                        “your vagina is more open and receptive at this time, so if there was a sex position you were
                        trying to achieve while in your period, yet failed in previous attempts, at present, you can
                        have it done”.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b><i>Mood improvement</i></b> - Often known as the feel-good hormones, endorphins which are
                        delivered to
                        the walls of the uterus revamps and boost your mood.

                    How to have sex during your Period
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Here are a few ways you can follow to make period sex exciting and less messy
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b><i>The right-minded partner</i></b> - Your companion must be the right-minded type. One who
                        can boost
                        the required confidence in you and illuminates the beauty in the goddess that you are during
                        this period. Discuss how you both feel about period sex, and proceed on the brighter side.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b><i>The scintillating foreplay</i></b> - During menstrual period, hormones tend to be mega
                        excited. It is
                        time you get scintillated through the foreplay approach. Foreplay becomes even more interesting
                        during this period. By implication, orgasm could be achieved with less effort by touching or
                        penetration. So, chaperone your partner to concentrate more in twiddling or caressing your
                        nipples, fingering the inner thighs and mildly respiring over the clitoris. Foreplays may be all
                        you need to get stimulated even into orgasm
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b><i>Make available some towels</i></b> - The last thing you would desire is seeing your
                        menstrual fluid
                        mess up your bedspread. Rather than bugging your mind on what has become of your sheets during
                        the naked dance exploit, spread a towel over your beddings to intercept blood leaks. If a lousy
                        scent profuse, rather than allowing it to ruin the moment, hunk a blanket above your mid-region
                        to catch the smell. At the end of the sexual exercise, use a tissue to clean yourself as you sit
                        up.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b><i>Adhere to the missionary position</i></b> - Assuming this position allows you to lie on
                        your back to
                        reduce blood drift as sexual intercourse lasts. Be particular about deep penetration. Your
                        cervix is lower with increased responsiveness and reactivity during the exercise. Alert your
                        partner to progress with care if it hurts.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b><i>The shower experience</i></b> - Are you fussy over blood? Then you can make the shower an
                        alternative. So, get it done in the shower. Aside from the fact that it makes the experience
                        less grubby, the action pace is varied. As the water flowing above you persist, the other
                        flowing beneath you is hard to notice. Momentarily, the flow seizes when you are sub-merged in
                        water thus paving the way for an unforgetable thriller.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b><i>Lighter days are ideal</i></b> - Ideally, you will want to stick to your lighter days. You
                        may not
                        need to drop your panties during day 1 and 2. Day 3 – 5 are just ideal as your flow get reduced.
                        Allow your expectation to accumulate during the initial days. However, if your partner feels
                        comfortable, the chips can still be laid down from day 1. The difference here is that the flow
                        is a bit redder
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b><i>Shower off</i></b> - There is the likelihood of having stains on your body during the
                        naked dance. So
                        get rid of them if your location wasn’t the shower. This leaves behind the feel-good mood.
                        Retain all materials and toys used during the exercise in a hygienic condition.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Finally, period sex is an exciting experience. It is incredibly healthy, and so nothing should
                    interfere in your sex life. The uterus desires to be adored at all times, so proceed with it
                    neglecting societal and environmental perceptions.
