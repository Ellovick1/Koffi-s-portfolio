                <p>
                    Did I tell you coffee serves as antioxidants? Yes, if you are seeking a good source of antioxidant,
                    then do away with wine, you can forget also fruit and vegetables; for coffee is mostly the chief
                    source of dietary antioxidants. Do you drink coffee? If no is your answer, then you have been
                    missing the best source of antioxidants. What is antioxidant? They assist in limiting chemicals
                    which are, usually exist as free radicals and causes cells degeneration. Can I shock you? In a study
                    which compared the antioxidant component of coffee to those from fruits, grains, wine, vegetables
                    and tea, the antioxidant in coffee was found to be 600% higher than all other food material.

                    Other health benefits of the of the coffee include but not limiting to; the prevention and
                    inhibition of tooth cavities, improvement of physical performance, reducing post work muscle aches,

                    the stomach, enhances intelligence, reduce diabetes and on the whole makes you happy. So when next
