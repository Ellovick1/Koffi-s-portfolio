                <h3>Your Breath: The New Way to Test for Diseases</h3>
                <p>
                    Testing for diseases by breathing is a noninvasive approach used by doctors to diagnose various
                    health-related issues. By examining your breath, doctors verify certain gases to conclude faster and
                    precisely. Increasingly, contemporary researches are confirming this notion with evidence on the use
                    of breath disease diagnostic approach — different diseases are ranging from minor to primary such as
                    cancer can be diagnosed just with a single breath into a breathalyzer. Since each condition has a
                    unique breath print, the breathalyzer has the potential to detect each person’s infection with about
                    86% precision. Aside from the breathalyzer, other facilities aid disease detection by breathing.
                    Let’s examine them-
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b><i>Breath test for Stomach cancer</i></b> - With the aid of a new technique termed Nanoarray;
                        early
                        detection of the cancers of the gut is now possible. This tech detects changes in the measure of
                        a particular compound in exhaled breath related to stomach cancers. Presently, potent
                        noninvasive approach to diagnosing stomach cancer is not available. This approach could be a
                        lifesaver to many and at a reduced cost
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b><i>Fructose and Lactose intolerance</i></b> - Fructose of lactose intolerant is a term which
                        connotes the
                        inability of the body to digest lactose and or fructose. Lactose is sugar contained in dairy
                        products. Fructose, on the other hand, is sugar found in artichokes, onions, pears, wheat, etc.
                        Consequently, digestion related issues including bloating, diarrhea and cramping may arise
                        whenever the patient ingests dairy product. The hydrogen breath test is used to verify lactose
                        or fructose intolerant condition. First, the host consumes a beverage with a substantial amount
                        of lactose or fructose. Periodically, the amount of hydrogen is examined in the breath for about
                        two hours. Bacteria ferment undigested lactose and fructose in the body to produce gases
                        including hydrogen. So, a substantial quantity of hydrogen in the breath is an indication that
                        the host might be lactose or fructose intolerant.

                    <li>
                        <b><i>Breath test and Diabetes</i></b> - Recently, in an outcome of research performed in
                        Massachusetts,
                        diabetics can be diagnosed by verifying the blood sugar levels in a single breath. In this test,
                        the acetone level which has been established to have an association with blood sugar level in
                        the breath is analyzed. A substantial amount of ketone bodies in the breath is an indication of
                        a diabetic condition termed Ketoacidosis.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b><i>Breathing test and Asthma</i></b> - Breathing test is used to detect asthma and pulmonary
                        related
                        issues by doctors. In this test, the volume of air the patient can exhale, and difficulty
                        experienced at inhaling is examined. Lower peak flow reading is an indication of non-functioning
                        lungs. Alternatively, an exhaled nitric oxide (NO) test, may be used to explore NO levels in the
                        breath. The breath is collected at the machine’s mouthpiece for sample collection. The body
                        produces the NO gas which is anti-inflammatory. A significant amount of the gas is an indication
                        of an inflamed air passage, a precursor for asthma
                    </li>

                        <b><i>Breath test and Bacterial</i></b> - Overgrowth Syndrome- Small Intestine Bacterial
                        Overgrowth (SIBO)
                        may occur as a result of uncontrolled bacteria growth in the small intestine. SIBO infected
                        patient suffers from excessive bloating, cramping, diarrhea and gas. Diagnosis is by the use of
                        a simple breath examination. Drink sugar solution, respire or breathe into the breathalyzer.
                        Fermented bacteria will be evident in your breath. Your doctor can confirm SIBO.

                        <b><i>Malaria</i></b> - Malaria, a pathogen harbored by an infected mosquito, is a major cause
                        of death in
                        the developing world. In 2013, about 198 million estimated case and 584 000 deaths were
                        recorded. Currently,, Australian Researchers opines a malaria diagnostic test. Here, malaria is
                        detected by sulfur-containing chemical compounds in a patient's breath.

                        is a bacteria
                        which is present in the stomach or duodenum. They are associated with chronic inflammation. A
                        relationship has been established between some health-related conditions and H. Pylori including
                        gastric cancers and peptic ulcers. The test procedures for H. Pylori is as scheduled:

                                    The patient goes without a meal or drinks an hour before the test

                The Advantages of the breathing test technique

               </h5>
                <p>
                    The traditional approach used in clinical diagnostics is costly and time-consuming — consequently,
                    this results in delays in treatments of diseases. The breathing method of diagnosis, though not
                    popular is currently underway. Early detection by this approach allows early treatment with improved
                    prognoses; Many patients avoid regular prophylactic owing to involvement in invasion and painful
                    procedures with its attendance adverse risk. Advancement in the use of devices and breath to analyze
                    diseases provides a new and noninvasive approach to diagnosis, early and faster treatment with a
                    prospect of a better outcome, and recovery.
