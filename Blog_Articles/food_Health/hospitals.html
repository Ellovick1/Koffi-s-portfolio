                    Hospitals or Death Traps? Presenting the Fact
                </h3>
                <p>
                    A hospital is an organized center set up for the provision of medical care to individuals.
                    Physicians, doctors, nurses, and other health workers work round the clock to save lives in the
                    hospital. Visiting the hospital is not an idea of a great time, but if there is a reason for having
                    to visit the hospital either now or later, it is imperative that you have a basic understanding of
                    the associated risk factors which you may be exposed. Do you know that while some people present
                    themselves to be cured of their ill-health, others contract and acquire same from the hospitals? In
                    recent times, the rate at which diseases typically known as healthcare-associated or
                    hospital-acquired disease increases is alarming. Seemingly, the debate on whether hospitals are
                    health care centers or death traps continues to emerge.
                </p>

                Healthcare-associated infections

               </h5>
                <p>
                    Over the last decades, the existence and unpleasant problems from healthcare-associated infections
                    (HAIs) have been acknowledged in the literature. HAIs continue to surge at an increasing rate.
                    Previously, the hospital acquired diseases were regarded as infections related to admittance in
                    critical care units in hospitals. Now, it also applies to those contracted while treatment in health
                    care facilities persists. This unexpected infections commence in the course of health care services
                    and result in consequential patient sickness and death. The patients stay in the hospital is
                    elongated and requires additional diagnostic and treatment interventions. Mostly, it necessitates
                    additional cost to those already incurred by the patient's initial infections. HAIs are the unwanted
                    outcome. Some can be prevented and are used as indices to access patient care quality in health care
                    facilities. Their mode of transmission includes direct contact with unsterilized equipment, hospital
                    staffs, and droplets from aerosol, food and ill patients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Healthcare-acquired infections (HAIs) are common than ever imagined posing a great danger to
                    persons and patients safety. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality opined that Americans in
                    their tens of thousands lose their lives annually. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
                    (CDC) also documented that, approximately one in twenty-five Americans catch Hospital Acquired
                    Infections every day. These patients are received in the hospitals, ill, exhausting, weary and
                    easily vulnerable to existing infections. Other people in the hospitals; some healthy, and others
                    sick can be a source of a pathogen. The moment a patient goes down with the disease, stay duration
                    elongates; some by months. In most cases, through effective management, control, and care, the
                    patients eventually exit the hospital while in other situations, they lose their lives. 99,000 out
                    of 1.7 million HA infected Americans die annually from those infections. Owing to the widespread
                    nature of HAIs, and the fact that many of them can be avoided, the Medicare system sanctions
                    hospitals with a high rate of HAIs. The sanctions are in place to support the hospitals to improve
                    their preventive approaches and strategies.

                    Common sources of diseases include

                </h5>
                <p>
                    As scheduled earlier, often regarded as nosocomial infection, HAIs are acquired as a result of
                    dereliction and violation of control practices and methods, non-sterile surfaces, sick patients and
                    untidy environment. Typically, surgical wounds infection, genitourinary infections, respiratory
                    disease, and gastrointestinal infections are chief sources. Each year, about 100 million surgical
                    procedures are scheduled and carried out in hospitals; conversely, a surge in nosocomial infection
                    cases is also documented worldwide. Patients regarded as immune compromised including the elderly
                    and children are at a higher risk of contracting them.

                        <b><i>Catheter-associated Urinary Tract Infections (CAUTI):</i></b> The urinary tract infection
                        (UTI)
                        diseases are an infection which involves the part of the urinary system viz- kidney, bladder,
                        urethra, and ureters. They are the most typical of the healthcare-associated disease brought to
                        the awareness of the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). About 75% of all UTIs contracted
                        in the hospital is related with the urinary catheter. The Urinary catheter is a hollow
                        cylindrical plastic thrust into the bladder via the urethra to withdraw urine. Roughly, 15 to
                        25% of all in-patients acquire urinary catheter during their stay in the hospital. An elongated
                        use of the catheter increases the risk of UTI infection

                        <b><i>Surgical sites Infection (SSI):</i></b> SSI is an infection which manifests after surgical
                        procedures
                        in the region of the body where the procedures were done. Seldom, the surgical site infections
                        could be the surface type which is associated with the skin while others may have an association
                        with internal organs or implanted substances. The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention
                        (CDC) gives measures and methods to healthcare facilities to assist surgical site infections and
                        resources and help create awareness of these infections and effectively work at forestalling its
                        occurrences.

                        <b><i>Ventilator-associated Pneumonia (VAP):</i></b> The Ventilator-associated pneumonia is an
                        infection of
                        the lungs that emanates from the use of the breathing enhancement machine (ventilator). The
                        ventilator is used to assist or achieve respiration on a patient. This is done by passing oxygen
                        to the lungs via a tube through the nose or mouth. There could be an infection if germs are
                        locking around the tube conveying oxygen into the patient's lungs.

                        <b><i>Clostridium difficile Infection:</i></b> Many persons receiving medical care contract the
                        infection
                        which may be caused by micro-organism termed as C. difficile. An estimated 500 thousands
                        patients who were admitted in US health facilities in 2011 died of C. difficile related
                        imfections. About 29,000 of this estimates lost their lives 30 days after diagnosis. Elderly
                        individuals are highly susceptible to this infection. Other related organisms in this class
                        include Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Vancomycin-resistant enterococci
                        (VRE), Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella
                        pneumoniae (CRKP), and Necrotizing fasciitis. These organisms are sometimes referred to as
                        superbugs because they are quite difficult to be killed.

                        <b><i>Associated bloodstream infections:</i></b> Inadequacies in management and control of
                        procedures
                        sometimes expose patients to diseases. For instance, the New Jersey Department of Health
                        reported a likelihood of exposing about 3,000 patients at HealthPlus Surgery Center in Saddle
                        Brook to HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. According to authority, patients who had surgical
                        operations in the facility between January 2018 and September 7, 2018, stood a high risk of
                        contracting the disease. Betty McCabe, the surgery center administrator, opined that the
                        inadequacies in the control and management (sterilization and cleaning) of instruments and
                        injectable might have predisposed patients to bloodborne organisms.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    From the above, what do you think? Are hospitals a death trap? To, avoid HAIs do the following:
                    Follow standard prevention provisions for infections and diseases control, wash and sanitize your
                    hands after every contact with surfaces and other infected patients, improve personal hygiene,
                    totally sterilize instruments, and improve environmental sanitation. Patients should also watch out
                    for themselves, maintain and follow best standards to curtailing the spread of disease. If in direct
                    contact with an infected patient, clean your hands. It may surprise you to know that only a few
                    hospitals make concerted effort to prevent HAIs, it is therefore imperative that patients live up to
                    the task of avoiding themselves from disease contraction. Wise patients do so.
