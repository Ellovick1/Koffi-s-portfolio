                    Obesity, what exactly is it?

                </h3>
                <p>
                    Obesity is referred to as a medical disorder that arises when an individual weight excessively. It
                    can also be defined as the accumulation of body fat that may hinder health. Usually, the obsessed
                    individual is subjected to an examination of the body mass described as the Body Mass Index (BMI).
                    BMI is the individual’s weight measured in kilograms per meters squared. An overweight adult
                    accumulates a BMI higher than or equal to 25 while a BMI higher than or equal to 30 means that the
                    adult is obsessed. An index such as the ratio of waist-to-height ratio (WtHR), and waist-to-hip size
                    ratio (WHR) are other indices used in determining the obsessed individual. Specific factors which
                    dispose one to obesity include – consuming excessively fats and caloric diet, a sedentary lifestyle,
                    less sleep, activity of the gene, age factor, and pregnancy. Medical conditions such as
                    osteoarthritis, hypothyroidism, Cushing syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome and polycystic ovary
                    syndrome (PCOS) are other causes of obesity.

                    Facts about Obesity

                </h5>
                <p>
                    Based on World Health Organization (WHO) global estimates, out of the 1.9 billion overweight adults
                    aged 18years and above recorded as at 2016, 650 million were obsessed. During the same period, the
                    proportion of global obsessed adults was scheduled at 13%. 11% of this proportion was male while 15%
                    was women. When compared with the 1975 measure, the global prevalence obesity index almost tripled
                    as 2016. For children under age five, an estimated 41 million were either obsessed or overweight
                    while about 340 million adolescents were either overweight or obsessed within the period in review.
                    Previously, obesity was considered a health-related challenge prevalent in the developed climes.
                    Today, it is more critical to the developing climes. For instance, In the African terrain, obesity
                    amongst children under 5years surged 50% since 2000 while nearly half of the population of children
                    who were either overweight or obsessed reside in Asia in 2016. By implication, between 1975 and
                    2016, the proportion of obsessed children surged from 4% to 18%. Globally, an increase in the
                    association has been verified between obesity, overweight, and death. Aside from parts of Asia, and
                    Sub-Saharan Africa, there are more obsessed people than underweight worldwide.

                    Effects of Obesity

                </h5>
                <p>
                    The results of obesity are manifold. The resultant effect is just more than a simple weight
                    accumulation. High body fat to muscle ratio weighs heavily on the bones and other internal organs.
                    Body inflammation, a precursor to cancer, is also associated with obesity. Other health
                    complications of obesity include the following:

                    Increase in BMI increases the likelihood of obesity. However, some of the ways by which obesity can
